.SUPER: **MONKEY MAGIC: THE JOURNEY BEGINS**

DARKNESS...

WU (V.O.)
In the beginning there was darkness. Primal Chaos ruled...

EXT. PRIMAL CHAOS - DAY

A volcano erupts.

Lava flows into the ocean.

WU (V.O.)
Heaven and Earth were obscure, and all things indistinct.

Winds lash a giant wave.

WU (V.O.)
It was not until the Great Pangu broke the mess apart that the clearing began.

EXT. SPACE - DAY

The big bang gives birth to the universe...

WU (V.O.) 
It was at this point, the firmament first acquired its foundation.

The Earth forms from stardust.

WU (V.O.)
With another five thousand years the light rose up to form the sun, the moon, the stars, and the Heavenly bodies. 

A milky way of stars shift into focus from a gassy nebula.

EXT. THE SUN - DAY

Solar flares leap from the surface of the sun.

WU (V.O.)
Then the sky began to harden and Earth became solidified. 

EXT. THE EARTH - DAY

The Earth looks much greener now with four large continents, not the continents we know today.

EXT. WILDERNESS - DAY

A river runs through a wild forest. 

Smoke drifts across, revealing a FIRE. 

WU (V.O.)
Then came the five elements of Water, Fire, Mountain, Stone and Earth.

Further up river is a large mountain. Day fades to night.

WU (V.O.)
In these five thousand years, the aura of Heaven descended and the aura of Earth rose up. All things began to grow. 

IMAGE: Flowers blossoming in slow motion.

WU (V.O.)
Heaven and Earth were bright and fair as the Yin mixed with the Yang. In another five thousand years, humans, beasts and fowls came into being, and thus the three forces of Heaven, Earth, and Man were established. 

CAVEMEN hunt wild boars. Chasing them.

EXT. THE FLOWER-FRUIT MOUNTAIN - DAY

A picturesque mountain top.

WU (V.O.)
It was on the mountain of Flower and Fruit, that the seeds of Heaven and Earth, the essences of the Sun and the Moon all worked upon a certain rock as old as creation. 

Lightning strikes the rock.

WU (V.O.)
And it became magically fertile. 

The rock tumbles down the mountain.

It hatches.

WU (V.O.)
From it, then came a stone Monkey.

The Stone Monkey jumps out from the rock-egg, flailing its arms.

EXT. THE JADE PALACE OF HEAVEN - DAY

THE BENEVOLENT SAGE is disturbed -- 

the glint cast by the stone monkey’s eyes, shines brightly.

WU (V.O.)
Heaven was momentarily disturbed when the glint in the monkey’s eyes cast a golden beam so bright it nearly blinded the Great Benevolent 
Sage. 

INT. THE WATER-CURTAIN CAVE - DAY

The Stone Monkey is now the Monkey King, and is gathered at a banquet with his MONKEY FOLLOWERS.

Over the course of the meal, he becomes melancholy.

WU (V.O.)
We could say many things about this stone monkey, who would become the Handsome Monkey King and enjoy many banquets, but the story really begins with a monkey troubled at his own impermanence...

MONKEY KING
Do I really have to die? And what is the point of it all! If we die, shall we not have lived in vain!

AN OLD MONKEY rises up from the crowd.

OLD MONKEY
The Great King is farsighted! It may well indicate the sprouting of his religious inclination. There are, among all the living creatures, only three species not subject to Yama, the King of the Underworld.

MONKEY KING
Tell me! I want to know!

OLD MONKEY
They are the Buddhas, the immortals, and the holy sages. These three alone can avoid the turning of the Big Wheel, and the process of birth and destruction.

MONKEY KING
Where do they live? I want to meet them and learn their secrets.

OLD MONKEY
They dwell within ancient caves on immortal mountains.

EXT. BEACH - DAY

The Monkey King sets sail on a makeshift raft. The monkeys gather around to send him off.

WU (V.O.)
And so the Handsome Monkey King prepared to travel to the ends of the Earth to find these three kinds of people in order to learn the secrets of immortality.

EXT. SEA - NIGHT

The ocean heaves, crashing down on the Monkey King.

MONKEY KING
Is that the best you can do!

EXT. BEACH - DAY

The Monkey King finds human clothing on the beach.

WU (V.O.)
Washing ashore many miles from home, the monkey took up the guise of a human...

EXT. MARKETPLACE - DAY

The Monkey King walks through a bustling crowd.

WU (V.O.)
... imitating human speech and human manners in the marketplaces. He was bent on finding the way of the Buddhas, immortals and holy sages. He saw however that the people of this world were all seekers of fame and fortune.

MONKEY KING
When will end this quest for fortune and fame? 

Monkey walks past a neighing mule.

MONKEY KING
Riding on mules they long for noble steeds. Now prime ministers, they hope to be kings. 

A POLITICIAN has gathered a crowd and is talking. Monkey continues through the marketplace.

MONKEY KING
For food and jewels they suffer stress and strain. Seeking wealth and fame and power to give to sons of sons. Do they not fear Yama?!

EXT. ROADWAY - DAY

The Monkey King walks along the road.

WU (V.O.)
For many years he roamed the land, searching for the way of immortality, but he had no chance of meeting it. 

EXT. BEACH - DAY

The Monkey King looks out across the ocean. He drags a raft into the sea.

WU (V.O.)
And then he came upon the Great Western Ocean and thought certain immortals would live beyond it, and so he set out once again across the seas.

EXT. SEA - DAY

The Monkey King valiantly paddles his raft.

EXT. THE WESTERN CONTINENT - DAY

The Monkey King lands ashore.

WU (V.O.)
After landing on the Western Continent, he searched for a long time, until finally he came across a magnificent mountain of Mind and Heart. And at the top of the mountain he found the cave of Slanting moon and Three Stars. And in that cave was the great immortal, Subodhi.

A GONG RINGS.

EXT. CAVE OF THE SLANTING MOON AND THREE STARS - DAY

Monkey knocks on the door to the cave. A DISCIPLE opens the door.

THE DISCIPLE
The master has been expecting you.

IMAGE: MASTER SUBHODI, a wise immortal, with long white wispy hair, beard, eyebrows, and a yak’s tail. Brushes imaginary flies away.

WU (V.O.)
Over several years the Handsome Monkey King learned many magical secrets from his Master, including the Art of Earthly Multitude and the seventy two transformations. He also learnt how to cloud fly. He was truly, Monkey Magic. He still lacked however, right judgement.

IMAGE: THE DISCIPLES all laugh and cry at Monkey Magic’s display of magic. He transforms into a PINE TREE! 

IMAGE: Master Subhodi is angered by the carry on.

WU (V.O.)
And he was banished for using his 
Magical talents so frivolously.

The door to the cave slams shut on Monkey Magic, who is now dressed in a red robe, yellow sash and black boots.

MONKEY MAGIC
Why have magic powers if you can’t show off a little?

Monkey summons his magic cloud, and flies off.

EXT. SKY - DAY

Monkey Magic cloud flies over the four continents.

WU (V.O.)
He had been gone some twenty years and on finding his way back he heard the call of cranes and the cry of monkeys. His spirit was moved with sadness.

EXT. FLOWER-FRUIT MOUNTAIN - DAY

Monkey Magic lands on the mountain. MONKEYS all crowd around him, crying.

YOUNG MONKEY
The Monstrous Demon King of Havoc has bullied us all these years!

ANOTHER MONKEY
He tried to rob us of our Water-Curtain cave!

MONKEY MAGIC
What sort of monster behaves with such lawlessness! Let’s see how he likes the taste of Old Monkey’s fist!

Monkey Magic summons his magic cloud and flies off.

EXT. WATER-BELLY CAVE - DAY

Monkey Magic lands next to some DEMON IMPS.

MONKEY MAGIC
Monstrous Demon King of Havoc! I'm here to settle the matter!

He shoos the imps away.

INT. WATER-BELLY CAVE - DAY

THE DEMON IMPS hurriedly run into the cave.

DEMON IMP #1
There is a monkey who calls himself Monkey Magic, King of the Flower-Fruit Mountain.  He says you have repeatedly bullied his young ones and has come to settle matters with you.

KING OF HAVOC
What kind of weapon does he have?

DEMON IMP #2
He is bare-fisted.

KING OF HAVOC
Get me my armour and my weapon. I’ll show this little monkey...

IMAGE: A SHARP SCIMITAR unsheathed. A black-gold helmet is removed from a shelf. Armour is laced up.

EXT. WATER-BELLY CAVE - DAY

Monkey Magic holds his fists out in a fighting pose. The ground shakes as the King Of Havoc arises from his cave.

KING OF HAVOC (O.S.)
Who is the Lord of the Water-Curtain Cave?

Day turns to night.

EXT. WATER-BELLY CAVE - NIGHT

The Monstrous Demon King of Havoc stands seven times taller than Monkey Magic.

KING OF HAVOC
Ha ha ha! How dare you be so insolent.

MONKEY MAGIC
You think I’m small! It’s hardly difficult for me to become taller! Don’t you know I can drag the moon down from heaven with these fists!

Monkey Magic leaps into the air and strikes a punch at the monster’s face. 

The monster parries the blow with his hand.

KING OF HAVOC
If I were to kill you with this scimitar, I’d be a laughing stock. Let’s see how well you can box!

The Demon King drops his weapon and holds up his fists. Monkey leaps forward, striking several quick blows to the monster’s chest, then to his face.

The Demon King recoils, and picks up his weapon. He swings it down on Monkey Magic, who dodges the blow. 

Monkey Magic pulls out a few of his own hairs and blows magic on them, transforming them into CLONES OF HIMSELF.

The little monkey clones overwhelm the Demon King, biting him and wrestling all his limbs. 

Monkey Magic picks up the scimitar and strikes a blow to the Demon King’s skull.

The sunlight of day returns.

Monkey Magic summons his magic cloud.

INT. WATER-CURTAIN CAVE - DAY

Monkey Magic enjoys another banquet.

OLD MONKEY
Three cheers for Monkey Magic, protector of the Flower-Fruit Mountain. Hip-hip!

THE MONKEYS
Hurray!

OLD MONKEY
Hip-hip!

THE MONKEYS
Hurray!

OLD MONKEY
Hip-hip

THE MONKEYS
Hurray!

MONKEY MAGIC
No-one should bother us again.

He sips on some wine.

MONKEY MAGIC
Although it would be better if I had some great weapon.

WISE MONKEY
I know where you could get a weapon, if only you could enter the ocean.

MONKEY MAGIC
I am the master of seventy-two transformations. I can go up to heaven, I can even walk past the Sun and the Moon without casting a shadow. There’s nowhere I can’t go.

WISE MONKEY
It’s a good thing that the Great King is magical for beneath us is the kingdom of Old King Dragon who rules the Eastern Ocean. He has weapons beyond measure.

Monkey Magic grins.

EXT. BEACH - DAY

Monkey Magic makes the magic sign and parts the water. He jumps into the ocean,

INT. EASTERN OCEAN - DAY

And swims past a school of fish, towards;

EXT. THE GREAT DRAGON PALACE - DAY

A jade green underwater palace.

INT. THE GREAT DRAGON PALACE - KING’S CHAMBER- DAY

A GUARD urgently runs up to the OLD DRAGON KING, an old man with a long black beard, sitting on his throne.

GUARD
Your majesty. There is a Monkey... he has entered the palace and is demanding a divine weapon!

OLD DRAGON KING
A Monkey?

A SCUFFLE can be heard down the hall. Monkey Magic wrestles FOUR GUARDS and enters the chamber.

OLD DRAGON KING
What chaos is this?

MONKEY MAGIC
Dragon King, I hear you have a weapon for Old Monkey!

OLD DRAGON KING
We have a few weapons, but none suitable for a monkey.

MONKEY MAGIC
Nonsense! You have treasures beyond measure, why not lend one to Old Monkey?

The DRAGON MOTHER and DRAGON PRINCESS join them in the chamber.

DRAGON PRINCESS
Great King, this is clearly no ordinary sage. That piece of rare magic iron has been glowing these past few days, perhaps as a sign...

OLD DRAGON KING
That, is the measure by which Great Yu conquered the Flood. No-one can lift it!

MONKEY MAGIC
No-one? We’ll see about that!

INT. PALACE TREASURY - DAY

The Dragon King, Dragon Mother, and Dragon Princess lead Monkey Magic to the centre of the palace treasury.

Before them is a large, glowing, rod, some twenty metres high, as thick as a tree.

MONKEY MAGIC
So this is the magic iron then?

Monkey leans over and grabs it with both arms, lifting it with all his might.

The Dragon King watches on in astonishment and terror.

DRAGON KING
No-one has lifted that since the Great Yu himself!

MONKEY MAGIC
It would be better if it was a bit smaller.

And with that, the iron magically shrinks down to half size.

MONKEY MAGIC
That’s better. A little smaller would be better still.

The rod shrinks further to a serviceable size.

Monkey Magic mock fights, spinning the rod back and forth.

The palace shakes.

MONKEY MAGIC
Now this is a great weapon!

Old Dragon King watches on in terror, pretending to smile.

OLD DRAGON KING 
Very good Old Monkey, very good.

Monkey shrinks the rod to the size of a toothpick and places it in his ear.

WU (V.O.)
And so the Handsome Monkey King found a weapon that could shake Heaven and Earth.

EXT. WESTERN HEAVEN - DAY

Old Dragon King enters through the gates of Western Heaven.

WU (V.O.)
And shake Heaven it did. The very same day, Old Dragon took his complaint to the Jade Emperor.

INT. HALL OF DIVINE MISTS - HEAVEN - DAY

Old Dragon King runs into the hall of divine mists and prostrates himself before THE JADE EMPEROR OF HEAVEN.

OLD DRAGON KING
Your Majesty, it’s a terrible thing, a monster has stolen the great iron that fixed the milky way and is wreaking havoc on Earth.

JADE EMPEROR
What kind of monster is it?

OLD DRAGON KING
A stone monkey. He has learnt The Way and mastered the seventy two Earthly transformations.

JADE EMPEROR
A stone monkey?

OLD DRAGON KING
We humbly beg for your imperial justice. We beseech you send the Heavenly hosts to subdue this monster!

OLD SPIRIT VENUS
Highest and Holiest grace!

OLD SPIRIT VENUS, rises from the court to address the Jade Emperor.

OLD SPIRIT VENUS
A stone monkey, born of the sun and moon, with a body nurtured by Heaven and Earth. A monkey who has the power to subdue dragons and tame tigers. Dare I suggest Your Majesty, to remember the compassionate grace of Creation and to issue a decree of pacification?

JADE EMPEROR
Even a Monkey could become an immortal, I guess...

OLD SPIRIT VENUS
Let him be summoned to Heaven and given some official duties. If he is disobedient to your command, we shall arrest him forthwith.

The Jade Emperor considers his proposal.

EXT. FLOWER-FRUIT MOUNTAIN  - DAY

Old Spirit Venus descends from the sky on his cloud. He lands  next to a group of YOUNG MONKEYS who are playing.

OLD SPIRIT VENUS
Monkeys! I am a heaven-sent messenger with an invitation for your king.

INT. WATER-CURTAIN CAVE - DAY

Monkey Magic is feasting at the banquet table.

LITTLE MONKEY
Great King, there’s an old man outside. He says he is a messenger from Heaven with an invitation.

MONKEY MAGIC
I was just thinking of making a little trip to Heaven, and now they’ve come to invite me!

EXT. WATER-CURTAIN CAVE - DAY

Monkey Magic meets Old Spirit Venus at the exit of the cave.

OLD SPIRIT VENUS
I am the Gold Star of Venus, from Western Heaven. I come bearing an imperial decree of pacification from the Jade Emperor.

MONKEY MAGIC
Pacification?

OLD SPIRIT VENUS
It’s more of an invitation you see... an invitation to Heaven where you will receive an *immortal* appointment.

Monkey Magic grins.

MONKEY MAGIC
Well? What took you so long?

He somersaults onto his magic cloud and flies off.

The Old Spirit Venus follows behind on his cloud.

EXT. SOUTH HEAVEN GATE - DAY

Monkey Magic arrives at South Heaven Gate, followed by the Old Spirit Venus.

The tall jade gate rises up from the clouds and is cast in shafts of golden light.

They enter.

Monkey Magic walks through mist filled streets, through;

EXT. THE GARDEN OF UNFADING FLOWERS - DAY

A garden full of flowers, with a pool of white lotus and bushes of pink jasmine.

MONKEY MAGIC
Oh, it’s very nice up here!

Old Spirit Venus smiles.

TWO GIANT DRAGONS with red-whiskers and golden scales wrap around the street, sleeping.

THE HEAVENLY BELL RINGER rings the bell.

THE IMMORTALS OF HEAVEN gather to the Hall of Divine Mists.

INT. HALL OF DIVINE MISTS - HEAVEN

The immortals prostrate themselves before the Jade Emperor, who takes up his throne.

Old Spirit Venus comes to the front of the court and prostrates himself.  

Monkey Magic joins him and looks around the room, arms folded.

A DIVINE OFFICIAL shakes his head in outrage.

OLD SPIRIT VENUS
Your humble servant has delivered the bogus immortal.

JADE EMPEROR
Which one is the bogus immortal?

MONKEY MAGIC
Old Monkey Magic, King of the Flower-Fruit Mountain.

DIVINE OFFICIAL
That wild ape! Does he have no manners?

JADE EMPEROR
Monkey Magic is a bogus immortal from the region below. We shall pardon him for his ignorance of court etiquette.

DIVINE OFFICIAL
Thank you, Your Majesty.

JADE EMPEROR
What vacant appointment may he receive?

THE STAR SPIRIT OF WUQU enters with a long list of official appointments.

STAR SPIRIT WUQU
There is no lack of ministers in the Palace of Heaven. But we could do, um, with a supervisor in the imperial stables...

JADE EMPEROR
Let him be made ‘Keeper of the Heavenly Stables’.

MONKEY MAGIC
‘Keeper of the Heavenly Stables’. What about ‘Divine Keeper of the Heavenly Stables?’

The Jade Emperor nods.

JADE EMPEROR
‘Divine Keeper of the Heavenly Stables’.

Monkey Magic grins.

EXT. THE HEAVENLY STABLES - DAY

Monkey Magic feeds the THOUSAND HEAVENLY HORSES, one by one.

WU (V.O)
The Monkey King diligently attended to his duties for several months. 

Monkey Magic oversees STEWARDS, who groom and wash the horses.

WU (V.O)
Then one day, various heavenly ministers came to congratulate him on a job well done.

EXT. HEAVENLY BANQUET - DAY

VARIOUS HEAVENLY MINISTERS sit at a banquet with Monkey Magic.

DIVINE OFFICIAL
A toast to the Divine Keeper of the Heavenly stables! If you keep up this good work, in five hundred years, you will earn yourself a Gold Star.

MONKEY MAGIC
A gold star?

DIVINE OFFICIAL
It would be in recognition of a "fairly good effort".

Monkey sips his wine.

MONKEY MAGIC
What sort of rank am I?

THE HEAVENLY MINISTERS nervously exchange glances.

DIVINE OFFICIAL
You do not really have a rank...

MONKEY MAGIC
So I must be the highest then?

DIVINE OFFICIAL
Not at all. Your rank is really 'unclassified'.

MONKEY MAGIC
What does that mean?

HEAVENLY OFFICER #2
It means you are the lowest of the lowly.

MONKEY MAGIC
Huh. The lowest. They thought they could trick Old Monkey. The lowest! Don't you know who I am!

Monkey Magic takes out his magic staff from his ear and kicks over the table.

GUARDS run in to arrest him, he fights them off --

and summons his magic cloud.

EXT. FLOWER-FRUIT MOUNTAIN - DAY

WU (V.O)
And so Old Monkey rebelled against heaven, returning to his Flower-Fruit mountain wherein he declared himself "The Great Sage, Equal to Heaven"

IMAGE: A BANNER - "THE GREAT SAGE, EQUAL TO HEAVEN" 

MONKEY MAGIC
That stupid Jade Emperor. Who does he think he is!

INT. HALL OF DIVINE MISTS - HEAVEN - DAY

CELESTIAL MASTER ZHANG prostrates himself before the Jade Emperor, then runs forward to the court.

MASTER ZHANG
Your Majesty! The Ape Monster has rebelled! He has declared himself "The Great Sage, Equal to Heaven".

JADE EMPEROR
That impetuous ape! Send forth the celestial soldiers to capture this monster.

EXT. WESTERN HEAVEN'S GATE - DAY

HUNDREDS OF CELESTIAL SOLDIERS march out from the gates of Heaven, diving down to Earth.

INT. WATER-CURTAIN CAVE - DAY

Monkey Magic stumbles to the banquet table, drunk.

MONKEY MAGIC
I am the Great Sage! Equal to Heaven! And I want more wine!

OLD MONKEY
Great Sage, the armies of heaven have descended to capture you.

MONKEY MAGIC
So they want to fight me, do they?

Monkey Magic drinks up his wine.

EXT. WATER-CURTAIN CAVE - DAY

The Celestial Soldiers have surrounded the cave. Monkey Magic stumbles drunk out to the centre of the enclave.

THE CELESTIAL GENERAL OF MIGHTY-SPIRIT, lands in front of him.

CELESTIAL GENERAL
Lawless ape! We have come to arrest you. Yield at once, to avoid execution.

MONKEY MAGIC
You go back to Heaven and tell that Jade Emperor that he has no regard for talent.

CELESTIAL GENERAL
You fraudulent monkey! How dare you call yourself “The Great Sage, Equal to Heaven"!

MONKEY MAGIC
You're quite right, I'm at least twice as good as Heaven! But! If am promoted according to this title, I will lay down my arms, and there will be peace on Earth. If not, I shall fight my way up to the Jade Emperor himself!

CELESTIAL GENERAL
So you want to be the "Great Sage, Equal to Heaven"? Take a bit of my axe first!

The General lunges at Monkey with his axe.

Monkey parries the blow. 

The combat of the heavenly general is graceful. Monkey stumbles, but is a drunken master.

Several celestial soldiers rush in.

Monkey enlarges his wishing staff -- spins it around -- whacking them.

He grins.

INT. WESTERN HEAVEN - DAY

The celestial soldiers of heaven are wounded, each in their own way. They groan and cry.

INT. HALL OF DIVINE MISTS - HEAVEN - DAY

The Celestial General prostrates himself before the Jade Emperor.

CELESTIAL GENERAL
I beg your merciful pardon... he is a very magic monkey. Your unworthy warrior could not prevail against him.

JADE EMPEROR
How powerful can one monkey be?

CELESTIAL GENERAL
He has set up a banner bearing the words "The Great Sage, Equal to Heaven". He said that he would declare his allegiance should he be granted this title.

JADE EMPEROR
What sort of compensation was he requesting?

CELESTIAL GENERAL
Your majesty, he did not mention any form of compensation.

JADE EMPEROR
And what duties did he ask for?

CELESTIAL GENERAL
Your Holy Grace, he did not ask for any official duty.

JADE EMPEROR
How dare this baneful monkey be so insolent!

The Gold Star of Venus steps forward.

OLD SPIRIT VENUS
Your Grace, might I suggest we indeed let him be made "The Great Sage, Equal to Heaven"; it will be an empty title. Rank without compensation. He will not be given any duty or office, but we shall keep him here in Heaven so that his perverse mind might be put at rest. Then, he shall desist from his madness, and the universe will be calm and the oceans tranquil once again.

The Jade Emperor nods.

JADE EMPEROR
We shall heed the counsel of our minister.

The Jade Emperor puts his head in his hands.

WU (V.O)
And so the Handsome Monkey King earned his title "The Great Sage, Equal to Heaven"

EXT. SOUTH HEAVEN GATE - DAY

Monkey Magic cloud flies to the gate. Old Spirit Venus flies beside him.

At the gate -- THE GUARDS OF HEAVEN hold their stance, austere. Monkey gets up close to them.

MONKEY MAGIC
Do they know who I am?

OLD SPIRIT VENUS
Of course, you are "The Great Sage, Equal to Heaven".

Monkey grins.

INT. HEAVENLY MANSION - DAY

Old Spirit Venus shows Monkey Magic his new home, a palatial mansion gilded in precious gems -- as one would expect in Heaven.

MONKEY MAGIC
So this is the house of the Great Sage!

Monkey lies down on the couch, he holds out his hands expectantly and ATTENDANTS bring him food and wine.

MONKEY MAGIC (CONT'D)
I could get used to this.

Old Spirit Venus bows.

EXT. HEAVENLY STREETS - DAY

Monkey Magic roams the streets of Heaven, joking with immortals, making faces, laughing, and mucking about.

WU (V.O)
Idleness and mischief are close companions. The Jade Emperor, fearing that idleness might lead to roguery, summoned the Great Sage for a special task.

INT. HALL OF DIVINE MISTS - HEAVEN

Monkey Magic stands leaning on his wishing staff before the throne of the Jade Emperor.

JADE EMPEROR
Great Sage, we perceive that you have nothing to do and have decided, therefore, to appoint you with a special assignment as "Protector of the Immortal Peach Garden."

Monkey's eyes light up.

EXT. IMMORTAL PEACH GARDEN - HEAVEN - DAY

STEWARDS tend to the garden, hoeing, watering, cleaning, and sweeping. 

Trees hold head-sized peaches from their branches. 

Monkey Magic enters.

MONKEY MAGIC
The Jade Emperor has authorised me to look after this Garden. I've come for an inspection.

THE ATTENDANT salutes him.

MONKEY MAGIC
How many of these trees are there, anyway?

ATTENDANT
Great Sage, there are three thousand six hundred. These twelve hundred on the outside have peaches that ripen every three thousand years. One taste and you'll become enlightened in the way and live forever. The middle twelve hundred trees ripen once every six thousand years. Eat one of their peaches, and you'll be able to fly! And at the centre, are twelve hundred trees with peaches that ripen only once every nine thousand years. If eaten, your age will rival Heaven and Earth, the sun and the moon.

Monkey gets an idea (to eat the peaches).

MONKEY MAGIC
You're all working too hard. As Protector of this garden, I think it wise for everyone to take a good well earned break and I'll keep a guard for you. How does that sound?

ATTENDANT
Thank you Great Sage.

The attendant indicates for the stewards to lay down their rakes and shovels. They leave.

Monkey Magic climbs up one of the trees and sits there.

He looks at one of the peaches. 

He plucks it and eats it. 

He plucks another one. And another.

FADE TO:

EXT. IMMORTAL PEACH GARDEN - HEAVEN - LATER

The peach trees have been completely stripped of their fruits.

SEVEN IMMORTAL MAIDENS carrying baskets walk around to the tree where Monkey Magic is asleep on a branch, having transformed himself to the size of a thumb.

BLUE MAIDEN
This is not good...

Monkey Magic falls out of the tree, transforming to his regular size. Startled, he whips out his magic staff.

MONKEY MAGIC
Thieves! Who has the gall to steal my peaches!

The maidens jump back.

RED MAIDEN
Great Sage, we mean no harm, we have simply come to harvest peaches for the heavenly peach banquet.

BLUE MAIDEN
We have been sent by the Lady Queen Mother.

They bow.

MONKEY MAGIC
Please arise divine maidens. Who is invited to this banquet?

YELLOW MAIDEN
Buddha, the Bodhisattvas, the holy monks, and the arhats of Western Heaven. Kuanyin from the South Pole. The Holy Emperor of Great Mercy of the East...

MONKEY MAGIC
And what about "The Great Sage, Equal to Heaven"? 

The Maidens exchange nervous glances.

MONKEY MAGIC (CONT'D)
Am I invited?

 BLUE MAIDEN
We did not hear your name on the list.

YELLOW MAIDEN
That doesn't mean you aren't? Or, not that we know...

MONKEY MAGIC
And tell me, where in Heaven is this banquet?

The blue maiden looks to the yellow maiden -- should she say?

EXT. HEAVENLY PEACH BANQUET - DAY

A large banquet is laid out, awaiting the arrival of guests. Monkey Magic jumps off his cloud and inspects the banquet.

MONKEY MAGIC
So they didn't think to invite Old Monkey? Well this looks very nice.

Monkey starts helping himself to the banquet, stuffing his face with handfuls of divine delicacies.

INT. HALL OF DIVINE MISTS - DAY

LADY QUEEN MOTHER OF HEAVEN rushes into the Jade Emperor's chamber.

QUEEN MOTHER
That awful monkey has ruined the festival!

The Jade Emperor puts his head in his hands.

EXT. FLOWER-FRUIT MOUNTAIN - DAY

Monkey Magic cloud flies to the bottom of the mountain.

An Old Monkey looks up to Monkey Magic in astonishment.

OLD MONKEY
The Great Sage has returned.

MONKEY MAGIC
They're all stuck up in Heaven. Anyway, very overrated.

OLD MONKEY
For the first time in one hundred years, the Great Sage has returned!

Monkeys rush out to greet him.

EXT. HEAVENLY PEACH BANQUET - DAY

The banquet is in disarray.

BUDDHA, IN FEMALE FORM, looks over the damage. She is with the Jade Emperor and the Lady Queen Mother of Heaven.

BUDDHA
And where did this monkey come from?

JADE EMPEROR
He was born of a rock on a mountaintop. Please, help us subdue this troublesome monster.

BUDDHA
Gentleness is needed in this case. I shall make him a wager.

EXT. FLOWER-FRUIT MOUNTAIN - NIGHT

Buddha appears on the horizon, a giant.

BUDDHA
Monkey awakened to Emptiness!

MONKEY MAGIC
The Buddha.

BUDDHA
Why are you so violent and unruly?

MONKEY MAGIC
I'm too special for Earth. Then, when I went up to Heaven they didn't recognise my talent, so I had to show them.

BUDDHA
What makes you think you are worthy of the Throne of the Jade Palace? Don't you know that the Jade Emperor has gone through the bitter experience of seven hundred and fifty ordeals, with each ordeal lasting a hundred and twenty-nine thousand six hundred years?

MONKEY MAGIC
Tell him to move out at once and hand the Celestial Palace to me. Or else I'll continue to cause ordeals and there'll never be peace!

BUDDHA
What powers do you have that you dare usurp this hallowed region of Heaven?

MONKEY MAGIC
I know the seventy-two transformations. I have a life that will never grow old and I also know how to cloud fly.

BUDDHA
Let me make you a wager. If you can somersault clear of this right palm of mine, I shall consider you the winner. I will ask the Jade Emperor to go live with me in the West, and you can have the Celestial Palace. If you lose, you shall go back to the Region Below and be a monster.

MONKEY MAGIC
Ha! The buddha is a fool! Don't you know who I am?

Buddha holds out her palm, which is a metre or so wide, Monkey Magic hops onto it. He summons his magic cloud, and flies off at full speed.

MONKEY MAGIC
See you, Buddha!

IMAGE: Monkey Magic a tiny streak of light and cloud, breaks through the sound barrier, hurtling towards;

EXT. THE FIVE PILLARS AT THE END OF THE UNIVERSE - DAY

Five flesh-coloured pillars rise up from a cloud.

MONKEY MAGIC
The five pillars! This must be the end of the road. I better leave a little memento.

Monkey plucks a hair from his body, breathing magic on it, transforming it into a writing brush soaked in ink.

On the middle pillar, he writes;

"The Great Sage, Equal to Heaven, was here"

He urinates on the first pillar.

He summons his magic cloud, and flies off.

EXT. FLOWER-FRUIT MOUNTAIN - NIGHT

Buddha smiles as Monkey lands back on her palm.

MONKEY MAGIC
Tell the Jade Emperor to give me the Celestial Palace!

BUDDHA
You silly ape. Since when did you ever leave the palm of my hand?

MONKEY MAGIC
I found the five pillars at the end of the universe and left a little memento there to prove it.

Buddha holds up her right hand to reveal that her fingers are the five pillars that Monkey defaced.

Monkey is astonished.

MONKEY MAGIC
I don't believe it! Could this really happen? Could it be? Let me go back there to check.

Before he can summon his magic cloud, Buddha grabs him. Her left hand transforms into rock, folding into a giant mountain. Trapping him.

EXT. HEAVENLY CLOUDS - DAY

THE THUNDER GODS, KASYAPA AND ANANDA watch on in delight.

KASYAPA
Buddha has subdued the monstrous Monkey!

ANANDA
Praise be to virtue!

A bolt of lightning materialises in Ananda's hand and he throw it down to Earth;

EXT. MOUNTAIN OF THE FIVE PHASES - NIGHT

LIGHTNING strikes the mountain top.

Monkey is stuck beneath the mountain, with just his face popping out through a crack.

MONKEY MAGIC
Buddha! You cheated! Let me out of this mountain! Buddha!

WU (V.O.)
And so the Buddha instructed Monkey in the ways of patience. For some five hundred years he remained trapped in that mountain. But that is not the last we shall hear of Old Monkey. Our story now turns to a Holy Monk, of origins most mysterious.

EXT. RIVER-SIDE - DAY

A BABY floats down river on a basket.

The basket comes to rest in some reeds. 

AN OLD MONK, discovers the baby. 

He lifts him out of the river.

WU (V.O.)
He was discovered floating down river. A baby, having been abandoned to the mercy of Heaven, with a letter written in blood tied to his chest.

The old monk takes the letter.

WU (V.O.)
But we shall say not more of that.

EXT. MONASTERY - DAY

A YOUNG BOY carries water to the temple.

WU (V.O.)
Time passed by like an arrow and the boy who they called "River Float" soon reached his eighteenth year.

> LATER:

The Old Monk shaves the young boy's hair.

WU (V.O.)
He shaved his hair, joining the practice of austerities, and earned his religious name "Xuanzang", meaning "Teacher".

> LATER:

XUANZANG prays to a statue of the Buddha.

WU (V.O.)  
Xuanzang pursued the Way with great determination. We could say many things about this Holy Monk, but his story really begins with a divine vision...

EXT. MONASTERY - NIGHT

Xuanzang prays in the courtyard.

A sudden wind sweeps up the leaves. Bright lights flash.

GUANYIN, THE COMPASSIONATE, appears as a glowing apparition.

GUANYIN
Hey Monk! You only know about the teachings of the Little Vehicle. Don't you know anything about the Great Vehicle?

XUANZANG
Guanyin, the most compassionate!

He bows his head in reverence.

GUANYIN
I have in my possession Tripitaka, three collections of the Great Vehicle Laws of Buddha, which are able to send the lost to Heaven, to deliver the afflicted from suffering and to break the cycle of birth and death.

XUANZANG
Really?

GUANYIN
These scriptures are so powerful that they can redeem dammed spirits from Hell.

XUANZANG
Please Guanyin, tell me where I can find these scriptures!

GUANYIN
Go West. Go to the mountain. Go to the Great Temple of Thunderclap. These scriptures can untie the knot of a hundred enmities, and can dispel unexpected misfortunes...

XUANZANG
Can you read me some of it?

GUANYIN
If I were just to read it to you, you probably wouldn't appreciate it!

XUANZANG
Please Guanyin!

GUANYIN
You must make The Journey to the West. The way: a hundred and eight thousand miles.

Guanyin vanishes in a cloud of smoke.

EXT. COURT OF THE EMPEROR - DAY

THE EMPEROR OF CHINA, TANG TAIZONG, sits on his throne.

WU (V.O.)
Wishing to cultivate the fruits of virtue, the Emperor received the news of the vision with great interest.

TANG TAIZONG
The Tripitaka you said?

XUANZANG
Yes your majesty, it was a vision as clear as day.

TANG TAIZONG
And who should seek for the Tripitaka?

XUANZANG
Though your poor monk has no talents, he is ready to perform the service of a dog and a horse. I shall seek these true scriptures on behalf of Your Majesty, that the empire of our king may be firm and everlasting.

TANG TAIZONG
If the Master is willing to express his loyalty this way, undaunted by the great journey, we are willing to become bond brothers.

Xuanzang bows his head to the ground.

TANG TAIZONG
Arise, our brother and holy monk, "Tripitaka".

The emperor smiles.

TANG TAIZONG
The years are long and the journey is great.

EXT. MONASTERY - DAY

Xuanzang, now TRIPITAKA, is farewelled by A GROUP OF MONKS. 

He rides his horse out of the gates of monastery.

  WU (V.O.)
The way West is filled with tigers, leopards and all kinds of monsters. And so Guanyin sought out a band of suitable protectors to be disciples of this most Holy Fool...

EXT. FLOWING SAND RIVER - DAY

Guanyin cloud flies to the river, with her disciple HUI'AN.

GUANYIN
This place is difficult to cross.

HUI'AN
Teacher, how wide do you suppose this river is?

She looks around in the water, when --

A FISH MONSTER leaps out from the depths, grabbing Guanyin.

Hui'an jumps into the conflict, wielding his rod -- battling with the monster, who stirs up waves.

They fight.

Hui'an blows wind, knocking the monster down.

HUI'AN
Monster! What quarrel have you with the Bodhisattva?

FISH MONSTER
The Bodhisattva?

The monster drops his weapon and bows before Guanyin.

FISH MONSTER
Please forgive me, Bodhisattva. I am no monster. Rather, I am the Curtain-Raising General who waits upon the phoenix chariot of the Jade Emperor of Heaven. 

EXT. WESTERN HEAVEN - PEACH BANQUET - FLASHBACK

THE CURTAIN-RAISING GENERAL, tries to put a broken jade cup back together.

FISH MONSTER (V.O.)  
I carelessly broke his favourite cup at the Festival of Immortal Peaches and was banished and changed into my present shape.

The Jade Emperor magically casts out the Curtain-Raising General. He falls to Earth.

EXT. FLOWING SAND RIVER  - DAY

The fish monster is in tears.

FISH MONSTER
I am cold and hungry and every few days I must find a traveler for food. I did not mean to offend the great, merciful Bodhisattva.

Guanyin takes pity on him.

GUANYIN
You were banished for your sin in Heaven, but now you add sin to sin by taking life in your present manner.

FISH MONSTER
I know, I know. I'm so miserable.

GUANYIN
There is a Holy Monk, a scripture pilgrim, join him on his journey to the west and seek refuge in right action.

FISH MONSTER
I must tell you a terrible thing. There have been a number of scripture pilgrims through here and I ate all of them. Their skulls floated on the water and would not sink so I chained them together with a rope...

Hui'an shakes his head in disgust.  

FISH MONSTER
I fear no other scripture pilgrim will want to come this way...

GUANYIN
Not come this way? How absurd! Take the skulls and hang them round your neck. There will be a use for them when the scripture pilgrim arrives.    And take this...

Guanyin throws down a MAGICAL RED GOURD. The fish monster catches it, looks at it.

GUANYIN
Do the right thing and I shall restore your post in Heaven... 

The fish monster dries away his tears.

Guanyin and Hui'an cloud fly away.

GUANYIN
"Sandy, who awakes to Purity".

WU (V.O.)
And so Sandy washed his heart and never took life again, but waited attentively for the arrival of the scripture pilgrim.

EXT. LAND OF THE EAST - DAY

Guanyin and Hui'an cloud fly towards a mountain covered in fog.

They enter the fog.

Suddenly, the fog clears to reveal a PIG MONSTER!

The pig monster strikes down on Hui'an with his muckrake.

HUI'AN
Reckless monster! Desist at once!

Hui'an battles the pig monster. His iron rod jabs the chest. The muckrake swipes his face. 

Their weapons weave and clash.

Guanyin magically casts lotus flowers, that rapidly blossom, overwhelming the monster.

PIG MONSTER
What region are you from, that you dare play this 'flower-in-the-eye' trick?

HUI'AN
I am the disciple of the Bodhisattva of the South Sea. These are lotus flowers thrown down by my mentor.

PIG MONSTER
Guanyin? The one who sweeps away the three calamities and rescues us from the eight disasters?

HUI'AN
Who else, if not she?

PIG MONSTER
Venerable brother! Please be so good as to make the introduction!

EXT. MOUNTAIN OF THE BLESSED MOUND - DAY

Hui'an leads the pig monster to Guanyin, who is praying.

PIG MONSTER
Bodhisattva! Pardon my sin! Pardon my sin!

GUANYIN
What region are you from, wild boar, that you dare bar my way?

PIG MONSTER
I am not a pig! My spirit lost the way for my next incarnation, and I passed through the womb of a sow and ended up with a shape like this! I took over this mountain and pass my days eating people.

GUANYIN
Where did your spirit come from?

EXT. WESTERN HEAVEN - NIGHT -- FLASHBACK

THE MARSHAL OF THE HEAVENLY REEDS, drunkenly flirts with the GODDESS OF THE MOON.

He chases her around heaven.

PIG MONSTER (V.O.)
I was originally Marshal of the Heavenly Reeds in the Heavenly River. I got drunk and dallied with the Goddess of the Moon, and so the Jade Emperor banished me to the world of dust.

EXT. MOUNTAIN OF THE BLESSED MOUND - DAY

The pig monster is in tears.

PIG MONSTER
I implore you! Save me!

GUANYIN
There is an old saying - 'if you want to have a future, don't act heedless of the future'.

PIG MONSTER
I would like to follow the truth, but since I have offended Heaven, even my prayers are worthless.

GUANYIN
There is a Holy Monk, a scripture pilgrim, follow him as his disciple and your merit will cancel out your sins.

PIG MONSTER
I'm willing! I'm willing!

GUANYIN
“Pigsy, who awakens to Power!"

Guanyin and Hui'an cloud fly off.

WU (V.O.)
From that moment on, Pigsy accepted the commandment to return to the real. He ate only vegetables, and fasted, so as to wait single-mindedly for the Holy Fool.

EXT. WILD STORM - DAY

Guanyin and Hui'an cloud fly into a thunderous storm with pouring rain.

HUI'AN
Look! Up in those clouds!

They ascend above the clouds.

A DRAGON is chained up, and weeping.

GUANYIN
What dragon are you and why are you weeping?

DRAGON
I am Aorun, son of the Dragon King of the Western Ocean. I accidentally burned down the palace, and my father, the king, charged me with grave disobedience. I am to be sentenced to death. Please save me!

GUANYIN
If I am to release you, then you must wait for the Holy Fool and carry him on his Journey West as a white horse.

DRAGON
I'll do it! Anything! Please spare my life!

Guanyin magically casts off his chains and the dragon falls to Earth, crashing through the clouds.

Guanyin and Hui'an cloud fly off. Coming to;

EXT. MOUNTAIN OF THE FIVE PHASES - DAY

A bright glow radiates from the top of the mountain.

GUANYIN
The seal of the Buddha.

HUI'AN
This must be the mountain where Buddha imprisoned the Great Sage, Equal to Heaven.

They fly closer.

MONKEY MAGIC (O.S.)
Hello! You over there!

INT. MOUNTAIN OF THE FIVE PHASES - DAY

Guanyin and Hui'an land next to the imprisoned Monkey Magic.

MONKEY MAGIC
My first visitors! I've only been here for five hundred years.

GUANYIN
Do you recognise me?

MONKEY MAGIC
How could I not! You are the Mighty Deliverer, the Great Compassionate Bodhisattva Guanyin of the South Sea. Show a little mercy and rescue Old Monkey?

GUANYIN
If I rescue you, I fear that you will again perpetrate violence and that will be bad indeed.

MONKEY MAGIC
I know the meaning of penitence. I entreat the Great Compassion to show me the proper path, for I am now willing to do the right thing.

GUANYIN
If your heart is set on the good, then wait here for a scripture pilgrim, a holy monk, who will set you free. Join him as his disciple on a Journey to the West.

MONKEY MAGIC
So, you're not letting me out? All you have to do is take down that stupid seal. I can do the rest!

GUANYIN
Patience. Wait for the Holy Monk.

Monkey Magic's face is full of disappointment.

GUANYIN (CONT'D)
"Monkey, Awakened to Emptiness"

WU (V.O)
So our Great Sage, with manifest nature and enlightened mind, returned to the path of good. But what of Tripitaka's path?

EXT. MOUNTAIN RANGE - DAY

Tripitaka is on a brown horse, accompanied by TWO MONKS.

WU (V.O.)
Having lost his way outside the city of Gongzhou, they stumbled into an ogre's pit.

IMAGE: Tripitaka and his companions fall into a pit.

WU (V.O.) (CONT'D)
The monsters, who captured them, ate both followers of the scripture pilgrim. It was only by divine intervention that Tripitaka was saved from this bitter ordeal.

IMAGE: The Star Spirit of Venus magically defeats the OGRE KING and his HENCHMEN.

IMAGE: He magically revives Tripitaka.

OLD SPIRIT VENUS
I am the Star Spirit of Venus from Heaven, who came to you by special request. Some pupils divine will come to your aid. Blame not the scriptures for the hardships that await you.

Tripitaka bows.

TRIPITAKA
I thank the Gold Star for seeing me through this ordeal.

FADE TO:

EXT. WINTERY MOUNTAIN RIDGE - DAY

Tripitaka rides on his horse, a lonely figure in the cold.

WU (V.O.)
Cold. Quiet. And still. Not a man in sight, the Holy Fool started up that rugged mountain, submitting himself to the will of Heaven. When he was disturbed by a piercing cry...

MONKEY MAGIC (O.S.)
My master has come! My master has come!

EXT. MOUNTAIN OF THE FIVE PHASES - DAY

Tripitaka rides his horse to the stone box, where Monkey Magic is imprisoned -- with his head and hands sticking out.

MONKEY MAGIC
Master, why have you taken so long? Welcome! Welcome! Get me out and I'll protect you on your Journey West. You are the scripture pilgrim, aren't you?

TRIPITAKA
I am, why do you ask?

MONKEY MAGIC
I am the Great Sage, Equal to Heaven. I was imprisoned here by the Buddha, some five hundred years ago. Guanyin persuaded me not to engage again in violence, but to faithfully follow the way of truth and to wait for you, my Master!

TRIPITAKA
Though you have good intentions, I have neither ax nor drill. How can I free you?

MONKEY MAGIC
See that seal? That is Buddha's seal. All you need to do is take it off.

IMAGE: The red seal of Buddha -- glows.

TRIPITAKA
I will say some prayers. If you are indeed destined to be my disciple, the seal will lift.

Tripitaka closes his eyes and prays. 

Magically, the seal flies off in a gust of wind.

MONKEY MAGIC
You did it! Master, you better stand back so that I can come out.

Tripitaka takes a few steps backwards.

MONKEY MAGIC
You might want to go back a little bit more furtherer.

EXT. MOUNTAIN OF THE FIVE PHASES - DISTANT - DAY

Tripitaka rides his horse a few miles away from the mountain.

MONKEY MAGIC (O.S.)
Ok! That should do it!

The Earth begins to quake...

Suddenly, the mountain explodes!

MONKEY MAGIC
I'm free!

Monkey Magic cloud flies around the exploding mountain and lands next to Tripitaka.

TRIPITAKA
Disciple, what is your name?

MONKEY MAGIC
You can call me "Monkey Magic".

TRIPITAKA
Why "Monkey Magic"?

MONKEY MAGIC
Because. I can look at a person and discern his character. I can listen merely to sounds and discover truth. If I want to be big, I can fill the universe. If I want to be small, I can be smaller than a piece of hair. You see, I know a lot of magic tricks.

Tripitaka smiles, relieved to have such a powerful disciple.

WU (V.O.)
So master and disciple, the two of them, chatted as they journeyed, and soon the sun sank in the west.

EXT. THE ROAD WEST - NIGHT

Monkey carries luggage, leading Tripitaka and horse.

Suddenly, A GANG OF BANDITS leap out from the forest brandishing swords, spears and all kinds of weapons.

BANDIT #1
Stop! Leave your horse and drop your bags, and we'll let you pass on alive!

Tripitaka faints from fright, falling off his horse. Monkey lifts him up off the ground.

MONKEY MAGIC
Don't worry, Master. It's nothing really, just some people coming to give us clothes and a travel allowance.

TRIPITAKA
Monkey, you must be hard of hearing, they told us to leave our bags and our horse and you want to ask them for a travel allowance?

MONKEY MAGIC
We'll see what happens...

BANDIT #1
You! Ugly monkey man. Are you deaf? 

MONKEY MAGIC
Sirs, for what reason are you blocking the path of this poor monk?

BANDIT #1
We are kings of the highway. Leave your belongings or we will chop you to pieces!

MONKEY MAGIC
You know, I was a king once.

BANDIT #1
You! A king!?

BANDIT #2
The monkey man is delusional!

The bandits surround Monkey Magic.

MONKEY MAGIC
Don't you know who I am? Now. Bring me the treasures you have stolen and I'll spare your lives.

Enraged, the largest bandit charges at Monkey with his sword. Monkey stands still as if nothing was happening.

SCHING! The sword bounces back from Monkey's hard head -- not leaving a scratch.

Another bandit charges at him with a spear SNAP! -- it breaks in two -- Monkey is completely unaffected.

MONKEY MAGIC
Time for a little entertainment...

Monkey removes the toothpick sized wishing rod from his ear -- swings it around -- it grows to full size.

The largest bandit pales in terror.

MONKEY MAGIC
Don't run! Let Old Monkey try his hand on you with this rod!

The bandits flee in all directions. Monkey chases after them.

Tripitaka watches on, horrified.

WU (V.O.)
And so Monkey chased down each of the bandits and beat every one of them to death. He seized their valuables and returned smiling...

Monkey Magic grins.

MONKEY MAGIC
You may proceed now, Master. Those robbers have been exterminated.

TRIPITAKA
What a terrible thing you have done! They may have been bandits, but they would not have been sentenced to death even if they had been caught and tried. You should have just chased them away. Why did you kill them all?

MONKEY MAGIC
Master! If I hadn't killed them, they would have killed you!

TRIPITAKA
I would rather die than practice violence. If I were killed, there would be only one of me, but you just slaughtered a dozen people!

MONKEY MAGIC
Do you think I would be "The Great Sage, Equal to Heaven" if I let robbers rob me! I've lost count of the number of people I've killed over the centuries.

TRIPITAKA
It is precisely because you had neither scruples nor self-control that you had to undergo your ordeal under that mountain. If you insist on practicing violence, you are not worthy to be my disciple. You're wicked! You're just too wicked!

MONKEY MAGIC
Fine! If that's what you think, you needn't bother me further with your nagging! I'll leave!

Monkey Magic summons his cloud and flies off. 

Tripitaka watches as he disappears over the horizon, breaking through the sound barrier.

TRIPITAKA
That fellow! He's so unwilling to be taught!

Tripitaka gathers his belongings and mounts his horse, setting off Westward.

FADE TO:

EXT. THE ROAD WEST - DAY

Tripitaka rides through desolate lands on the journey west.

FADE TO:

EXT. WATERFALL - DAY

Tripitaka dismounts and ties his horse to a tree.

He drinks from the pool beneath the waterfall.

AN OLD LADY covered in sores, approaches.

OLD LADY
Elder, where do you come from and why are you walking here all by yourself?

TRIPITAKA
Your child was sent by the Great King to seek the true scriptures from the Temple of the Thunderclap.

OLD LADY
The journey there is one hundred and eight thousand miles. You are all by yourself with neither companion nor disciple. How can you  possibly think of going there?

TRIPITAKA
I had a disciple until a few days ago. I scolded him a little, but he refused to be taught and then he disappeared.

OLD LADY
I have just finished mourning the loss of my son. He was a monk like you. I was given this by his master, to be kept in his memory.

She pulls a Golden Headband out from her bag. It glistens.

OLD LADY
I want you to have it.

TRIPITAKA
I dare not take it.

The old lady chuckles.

OLD LADY
This is no ordinary headband. I have a spell called "True Words for Controlling the Mind". Take this headband and when he returns, give it to him. If he refuses to obey you, recite the spell silently. He will not leave you again.

Tripitaka takes the headband and holds it. 

When he looks up the old lady has vanished.

TRIPITAKA
Guanyin!

Tripitaka sits, practicing the spell.

WU (V.O.)
And so Tripitaka practiced the spell, until he knew the words by heart. Old Monkey, having left his master, headed straight to the Water Crystal Palace of the Eastern Ocean.

INT. WATER CRYSTAL PALACE - DAY

Monkey sits having tea with the DRAGON KING OF THE EASTERN OCEAN.

WU (V.O.)
Wherein he met with Old King Dragon...

MONKEY MAGIC
That Holy Fool knows nothing of human nature. There were a few ruffians who wanted to rob us, and so I slew them all. But Tripitaka wouldn't stop nagging me and telling me how wrong I was. Can you imagine Old Monkey putting up with that sort of tedium?

DRAGON KING
Great Sage, if you do not accompany the Holy Monk, if you are unwilling to exercise diligence or to accept instruction, you will remain a bogus immortal after all.

Monkey Magic sips his tea, heeding these words of wisdom.

WU (V.O.)
Old Dragon regaled Monkey with stories of legendary immortal Master Red Pine. And so Monkey took heed of his wisdom.

MONKEY MAGIC
Fine then! I'll go back!

Monkey summons his magic cloud and flies off.

EXT. THE ROAD WEST - DAY

Tripitaka is sitting dejectedly at the side of the road. Monkey Magic lands next to him.

MONKEY MAGIC
Master, why are you not on the road? What are you doing here?

TRIPITAKA
Your absence has forced me to sit here and wait for you.

MONKEY MAGIC
I was just gone for a little tea with Old King Dragon of the Eastern Ocean.

TRIPITAKA
Disciple, don't lie! It was less than an hour since you left me, how could you claim to have visited the Eastern Ocean?

MONKEY MAGIC
I can fly one hundred and eight thousand miles in single somersault! That's why I can go and return in no time at all.

TRIPITAKA
So while you're off having tea I have to sit here and endure hunger. Do you feel good about that?

MONKEY MAGIC
I can go beg some food for you?

TRIPITAKA
There's no need, fetch the dried fruits from my bag.

Monkey goes to the luggage and discovers the Golden Headband.

MONKEY MAGIC
Wow! What's this?

TRIPITAKA
Oh that? That's nothing. Just something I wore in my childhood.

MONKEY MAGIC
Master, can I try it on?

TRIPITAKA
It might not fit properly...

Monkey Magic puts on the Golden Headband.

MONKEY MAGIC
How does it look?

TRIPITAKA
Sorry Monkey...

Tripitaka starts to recite the spell.

MONKEY MAGIC
Ow! My head! It hurts! It hurts!

Monkey rolls around on the ground, trying to pry off the headband. Tripitaka stops saying the spell.

Monkey gets up and tries to take off the headband. It's stuck. He shoves his rod in to try and wedge it out. Tripitaka says the spell again.

MONKEY MAGIC
Ow! That really hurts! Stop it! 

Tripitaka stops the spell.

MONKEY MAGIC
Master has put a spell on it!

TRIPITAKA
I was just saying a little prayer.

MONKEY MAGIC
Yeah well say it again and see what happens!

Tripitaka silently recites the spell again.

MONKEY MAGIC
Ow! Stop! Stop! It hurts!

TRIPITAKA
Now will you listen to my instructions?

MONKEY MAGIC
Yes, I will.

TRIPITAKA
And never be unruly?

MONKEY MAGIC
I dare not.

Tripitaka stops the spell.

In a flash of rage, Monkey swings his wishing staff at Tripitaka -- who engages the spell -- causing him to fall to the ground in pain.

MONKEY MAGIC
Master! Please I've learned my lesson! Stop! Please stop!

Tripitaka stops the spell.

TRIPITAKA
Will you follow my instruction?

MONKEY MAGIC
I will! But don't go saying that spell for no reason.

TRIPITAKA
Help me onto the horse and let's get going.

FADE TO:

EXT. EAGLE GRIEF STREAM - DAY

Tripitaka and Monkey arrive at the bank of the stream.

MONKEY MAGIC
This is the Serpent Coil Mountain.

Tripitaka and Monkey look into the stream, when suddenly --

A WHITE DRAGON splashes up from the depths, darting straight for Tripitaka. Monkey pulls him out of harm's way.

The Dragon dives back into the stream.

The horse has vanished.

MONKEY MAGIC
Master, that dragon has swallowed our horse!

TRIPITAKA
If it has been eaten, how can I walk through those thousand hills and ten thousand waters?

Monkey takes out his magic rod and walks over to the bank of the stream.

MONKEY MAGIC
Lawless Lizard! Return my horse!

TRIPITAKA
Monkey! What are you doing?

MONKEY MAGIC
I'm going to get my horse back. Return my horse you ugly snake!

The Dragon splashes back above the stream.

WHITE DRAGON
Who dares insult me with his big mouth?

MONKEY MAGIC
Just a cheeky Monkey. But you can call me "The Great Sage, Equal to Heaven!"

Monkey runs across the surface of the water, lunging at the dragon with his rod.

The dragon breathes fire!

They fight!

Monkey wedges his rod in the dragon's open jaw. 

The dragon spews more fire! Monkey jumps out of the way.

The dragon retreats back into the depths.

Monkey returns to Tripitaka.

TRIPITAKA
You said you could tame dragons and subdue tigers. Why can't you subdue this one?

Monkey Magic takes a deep breath to calm his anger.

MONKEY MAGIC
Fine. I'll go show him who is master!

Monkey leaps into the stream. Tripitaka goes over to look into the depths.

Some bubbles come to the surface.

Suddenly, Monkey emerges from the water atop a WHITE HORSE.

He rides over to Tripitaka, triumphant.

TRIPITAKA
What happened down there?

MONKEY MAGIC
It turns out this Dragon was freed by Guanyin in order to help you on your journey. So I changed him into a horse.

TRIPITAKA
How?

MONKEY MAGIC
Monkey Magic.

FADE TO:

EXT. THE ROAD WEST - DAY

A YOUNG MAN, walks towards Tripitaka and Monkey Magic.

YOUNG MAN
Are you Holy Priests?

MONKEY MAGIC
Yes, what is it to you?

YOUNG MAN
I was hoping you would say a prayer for my sister. She needs some help, you see. Where are you headed?

TRIPITAKA
We are scripture pilgrims on a Journey to India.

YOUNG MAN
My village is five miles West of here. I can offer you some food and lodgings. Father can explain.

EXT. GAO VILLAGE - DAY

Tripitaka and Monkey Magic enter the village.

VILLAGERS look on at them, expectantly.

INT. GAO VILLAGE - COTTAGE - DAY

The young man introduces Tripitaka and Monkey to his FATHER.

FATHER
Are these the exorcists?

MONKEY MAGIC
I am the Great Sage, and this is my Master, Tripitaka.

YOUNG MAN
They are Holy Monks, who have travelled a great distance.

FATHER
It's about my son-in-law. We never had a son you see. We were hoping to find an heir. He married my youngest daughter. Things were going well. He worked the fields without even using a buffalo. And  had an appetite to match. Then, he started to change...

TRIPITAKA
What do you mean?

FATHER
His appearance...

MONKEY MAGIC
Don't be shy, what did he look like?

FATHER
This whole affair has brought shame on our family. We haven't seen our daughter for more than a year. We don't know if she is alive or dead.

MONKEY MAGIC
So he's some kind of monster?

FATHER
A pig monster!

TRIPITAKA
A pig monster?

MONKEY MAGIC
You're in luck. Because we are, in fact, most experienced at capturing monsters.

WU (V.O.)
And so Monkey obtained the full details of the affair, including the known whereabouts of the pig monster.

Monkey summons his magic cloud, and flies off.

EXT. PIG MONSTER'S DEN - DAY

Monkey lands outside the entrance to the den. He calls out into the darkness.

MONKEY MAGIC
Hello?

GREEN ORCHID (O.S.)
Hello?!

MONKEY MAGIC
I am the Great Sage, Equal to Heaven and I've come to rescue you from the pig monster!

An awkward pause.

GREEN ORCHID (O.S.)
He's not here!

MONKEY MAGIC
Don't be silly, I can smell him! Come out here you pig monster! Let Old Monkey fry your bacon!

The Pig Monster emerges from the den, putting his shirt on.

GREEN ORCHID 
Don't hurt him!

PIG MONSTER
I'm not afraid of you Great Sage. You see this muckrake. This muckrake was forged in heaven by the finest steel. Mars himself added the charcoals piece by piece.

MONKEY MAGIC
Don't brag too much, idiot! Old Monkey will stretch out his head right here and you can give it a blow!

The Pig Monster looks at him uncertain.

PIG MONSTER
Are you sure? I might just knock your head off completely.

MONKEY MAGIC
Hit me you stupid hog!

The Pig Monster strikes down on Monkey with all his might --sparks fly -- it bounces back. Monkey is unharmed.

Pigsy cowers. Green Orchid runs over to protect him.

PIG MONSTER
Don't hurt me! We're just young and in love! Is that so wrong?

Monkey holds up his rod and is about to strike --

GREEN ORCHID
The Monkey has come to steal all your gold and treasures!

MONKEY MAGIC
Me? I'm a holy monk, not a thief. Besides, this pig has no treasures.

She recoils from him with utter disgust.

GREEN ORCHID
You ugly lying swine! Where are my treasures!

PIG MONSTER
Sweetheart! I was just talking figuratively...

She slaps him and runs away.

PIG MONSTER
Great Sage, have you simply come here to terrorise me? What is your reason for being here?  

MONKEY MAGIC
If you must know, I am accompanying a scripture pilgrim.

Pigsy's eyes light up.

PIG MONSTER
Please! I submit! Take me to meet this Holy Monk!

EXT. GAO VILLAGE - DAY

Monkey leads Pigsy, who is tied up, through the village.

VILLAGERS glare at him.

MONKEY MAGIC
Master, this pig monster has requested an audience. Speak, idiot!

PIG MONSTER
I am the Marshall of the Heavenly Reeds, I got drunk and dallied with the Goddess of the Moon and was banished to Earth. Guanyin, the compassionate, promised to free me from this incarnation, should I accompany you on your scripture pilgrimage.

TRIPITAKA
If you are to be my disciple, will you follow the practice of austerities?

Pigsy reluctantly nods.

PIG MONSTER
A little drink here or there wouldn't hurt, would it?

The Father watches on.

FATHER
I cannot thank you enough. What gifts can I give you?

TRIPITAKA
We are Holy Monks, we cannot accept any gratuity.

PIG MONSTER
Master, some new shoes would be nice. Or at least some food for the journey.

MONKEY MAGIC
Shut-up! Didn't you hear what the Master said? You're a Holy Monk now!

Green Orchid glares venomously at Pigsy as they depart.

WU (V.O.)
And so Pigsy entered their fold, leaving behind worldly pleasures for the many trials and tribulations that would await them.

EXT. THE ROAD WEST - DAY

Tripitaka, Monkey and Pigsy travel west.

WU (V.O.)
The three of them proceeded toward the West, and for about a month it was an uneventful journey.

EXT. PAGODA MOUNTAIN - DAY

Pigsy stops, looks up at a tree.

PIGSY
I know this place.

TRIPITAKA
Where are we?

PIGSY
The crow lives here.

Above them, a murder of crows.

The murder dives down on them!

And materialise into the CHAN MASTER, who stands before them.

CHAN MASTER
Hello Pigsy, how do you have the good fortune to journey with the Holy Monk?

MONKEY
Who is this person? And why does he recognise you, and not me?

PIGSY
He is a Holy Man, like Master.

CHAN MASTER
I haven't yet had the pleasure of meeting you.

TRIPITAKA
This is my disciple, Monkey Magic.

CHAN MASTER
On your journey West?

TRIPITAKA
How did you know?

PIGSY
He has knowledge of past and future events.

TRIPITAKA
Will we make it to India?

The Chan Master smiles.

CHAN MASTER
Though it may be very far, you will arrive there one day.

TRIPITAKA
Teacher, how did you become so accomplished in the way?

CHAN MASTER
In emptiness, there are no forms and no sensations, perceptions, volition, or consciousness. Because there is nothing to be attained, the mind of the Bodhisattva has no hindrances, no terror or fear. He is far removed from error and delusion. Thus I impart these words to help you on your journey.

Tripitaka bows to express his gratitude.

The Chan Master smiles, disintegrates into a murder of crows, and flies away.

FADE TO:

EXT. DUE-TO-FALL MOUNTAIN - DAY

The three walk into a gully. A WILD WIND sweeps up.

TRIPITAKA
The wind is rising!

MONKEY MAGIC
Why fear the wind? Nothing to be afraid of.

PIGSY
The wind is too strong! Let's find shelter until it dies down.

MONKEY MAGIC
What would happen if you were to meet a monster face to face? Although there is something strange about this wind...

Monkey sniffs the wind.

MONKEY MAGIC
Smells like a tiger. Or some other sort of monster.

Suddenly, A TIGER appears, roars at Monkey.

PIGSY
Cursed beast!

Pigsy charges at the tiger with his muckrake. 

The tiger morphs into A VANGUARD SOLDIER, wearing tiger skin.

TIGER SOLDIER
I am the vanguard of the army of Great King Yellow Wind and you look like the perfect hors d’oeuvres!

PIGSY
We're not food, we're holy monks!

Pigsy and the soldier fight!

The tiger soldier parries the muckrake, morphs into the wind.

TIGER SOLDIER
Ha ha ha ha!

Tripitaka has vanished!

MONKEY MAGIC
He took the master!

EXT. CAVE OF THE YELLOW WIND KING - DAY

TWO GUARDS stand in front of the door to the cave.

The tiger soldier carries Tripitaka over his shoulder.

TIGER SOLDIER
Go report to the Great King and say that the Tiger Vanguard has captured a monk.

INT. CAVE OF THE YELLOW WIND KING - DAY

The tiger soldier kneels before the GREAT KING YELLOW WIND, with Tripitaka, who is tied up.

TIGER SOLDIER
Great King! I have captured a monk for your culinary pleasure. How would you like him? Steamed or Fried?

KING YELLOW WIND
I have heard some rumours, that this is Tripitaka, the divine monk in search of scriptures by imperial decree of the Great Tang. Was he alone?

TIGER SOLDIER
He has, in fact, two disciples. I changed my form and escaped them.

KING YELLOW WIND
Rumours are that he has under him a disciple whose name is Monkey Magic, and who possesses tremendous magical power...

TIGER SOLDIER
There was a Pig and a Monkey, but they did not seem very impressive.

KING YELLOW WIND
Tie him up. We'll wait three or four days. Then, if we are undisturbed, we can eat him!

SEVEN DEMONS rush up from the sides, grabbing Tripitaka, dragging him away.

EXT. DUE-TO-FALL MOUNTAIN - DAY

Pigsy and Monkey look around for their master.

PIGSY
Heavens! Heavens! They've taken Master away!

Pigsy cries.

MONKEY MAGIC
Don't cry! The moment you cry, you already feel defeated. They have to be somewhere in this mountain. Let's search for them!

Monkey leads Pigsy on the search.

WU (V.O.)
They searched for a long time, until finally they found the entrance to the cave...

EXT. CAVE OF THE YELLOW WIND KING - DISTANT - DAY

Monkey and Pigsy crouch behind a rock, watching the guards in the distance.

MONKEY MAGIC
You wait here. Old Monkey will go rescue Master.

PIGSY
Go quickly!

Monkey marches over to the guards.

MONKEY MAGIC
Monster! Send out my master at once, lest I level your dwelling!

INT. CAVE OF THE YELLOW WIND KING - DAY

A LITTLE DEMON runs over to the Yellow Wind King.

LITTLE DEMON
Disaster!

KING YELLOW WIND
What's the matter?

LITTLE DEMON
Outside the cave door is a Monk, who calls himself Monkey Magic. He is demanding the return of his master.

The Yellow Wind King turns to the Tiger Soldier.

KING YELLOW WIND
I asked you to patrol the mountain, catch a few buffalo, wild boar or goat. Instead, you've caught a Holy Monk and upset the Great Sage, Equal to Heaven!

TIGER SOLDIER
Put your worries to rest, I will capture this Magic Monkey and serve him as a condiment for your meal.

IMAGE: The tiger soldier grabs two bronze scimitars.

EXT. CAVE OF THE YELLOW WIND KING - DAY

The tiger soldier marches out the door of the cave.

TIGER SOLDIER
Where did you come from monkey, that you dare make such a racket!

MONKEY MAGIC
You tricky tiger. You better send my master out immediately or I won't spare your life.

TIGER SOLDIER
I took your master so he could be served to my Great King as meat for his rice. Now I'll catch you too and you'll be eaten along with him.

MONKEY MAGIC
You've got a very big mouth, but can you fight?

Monkey lunges at him with his rod.

They fight!

The tiger soldier is quick, transforming into wind and back again, circling Monkey.

Monkey has the upper hand. The tiger soldier retreats, heading towards Pigsy -- who strikes with his muckrake.

The tiger soldier explodes into a ball of flames.

INT. CAVE OF THE YELLOW WIND KING - DAY

ANOTHER LITTLE DEMON runs in.

LITTLE DEMON
Great King! The Tiger Soldier was beaten to death by the ugly monk.

KING YELLOW WIND
This fellow does not know when to stop! I have not eaten his master, but he has killed my best soldier! Bring me my armour!

A GROUP OF DEMONS quickly bring out the golden armour, which is buckled and laced. He grabs a steel trident.

EXT. CAVE OF THE YELLOW WIND KING - DAY

King Yellow Wind emerges from the cave door, armour glistening.

KING YELLOW WIND
Who is this “Monkey Magic"?

MONKEY MAGIC
Old Monkey is here! Send my master out at once!

King Yellow Wind looks him up and down -- he's a midget.

KING YELLOW WIND
Too bad! I thought you were some kind of invincible hero. But you are only a midget!

MONKEY MAGIC
I can grow bigger if I want to. Hit me on the head, see what happens!

KING YELLOW WIND
Harden your head, and have a taste of my trident!

King Yellow Wind darts forward, striking Monkey on the head.

Monkey magically grows three times his size.

KING YELLOW WIND
How dare you stand at my door, displaying this paltry magic! Stop using tricks!

King Yellow Wind jabs Monkey with his trident. Monkey, unperturbed, parries with his rod. King Yellow Wind becomes enraged.

They battle fiercely. Trident meets rod. Back and forth.

Monkey pulls out some of his hairs, breathing magic on them, transforming them into clones of himself.

A HUNDRED MONKEYS surround King Yellow Wind, each with a rod.

King Yellow Wind takes a deep breath in. He blows a fierce wind! It sends the monkeys reeling through the air.

EXT. GAO VILLAGE - DAY

Green Orchid is blown sideways by the wind.

EXT. WESTERN HEAVEN - DAY

The Seven Maiden's dresses are caught up in the wind.

EXT. HELL - DAY

THE TEN KINGS OF YAMA have their records of the living and the dead blown asunder.

EXT. CAVE OF THE YELLOW WIND KING - DAY

Monkey lifts his rod to attack King Yellow Wind -- who blows wind in Monkey's face.

Monkey falls to the ground, unable to open his eyes.

He rolls around in pain.

The wind recedes.

Pigsy approaches him.

PIGSY
Elder brother! What a mighty wind!

MONKEY MAGIC
In all the years since Old Monkey was born, I have never witnessed such a violent wind.

PIGSY
Did you get him?

MONKEY MAGIC
His technique was formidable. And he knows how to use the trident! That wind of his is vicious, and makes it hard to defeat him.

PIGSY
How are we going to rescue master?

MONKEY MAGIC
We'll have to wait. I wonder if there is any eye doctor around here who can look at my eyes.

PIGSY
What's the matter with your eyes?

MONKEY MAGIC
That monster blasted wind in my face, now I can't see a thing! Just blurs and shadows.

PIGSY
Monkey, we are in the middle of a mountain, and it's getting late. Let's not talk about eye doctors; we don't even have a place to stay.

MONKEY MAGIC
I doubt that monster has the gall to harm our master. Let's find our way back to the main road and see if we can find somewhere to stay. We can subdue the monster tomorrow.

WU (V.O.)
And so they left the fold of the mountain and went up the road. The blind leading the blind.

EXT. THE ROAD WEST - NIGHT

Pigsy leads the blind Monkey along the road.

WU (V.O.)
Walking a short distance they arrived at the door of a particular household.

Pigsy knocks on the door.

PIGSY
Open up! Open up!

AN OLD MAN opens the door ajar, is backed up by SEVERAL FARMERS each holding rakes, pitchforks and brooms. Nervous.

OLD MAN
Who are you?

MONKEY MAGIC
We are disciples of a holy monk from the Land of the East. As we passed through this mountain our master was captured by the Yellow Wind Monster. Since it is getting late, we have come to beg for lodgings.

The Old Man looks at them and opens the door. He has a walking stick with a dragon carved into it.

OLD MAN
This is a place where clouds are more numerous than people. We were afraid that you might be someone like a wily fox, a tiger or a mountain bandit. Please come in.

INT. MOUNTAIN COTTAGE - NIGHT

Pigsy and Monkey scoff down the bowls of rice their hosts have prepared for them.

MONKEY MAGIC
May I ask the good man whether there is someone in the region who sells eye medicine?

OLD MAN
Which of you has the eye disease?

MONKEY MAGIC
I do. I was blasted by the Yellow Wind trying to rescue my master.

OLD MAN
No one can survive the Yellow Wind. You must be some sort of immortal?

MONKEY MAGIC
Well, I am. Just a little bit. Anyway, my eyes really hurt after that and I can hardly see.

OLD MAN
I myself suffer from sore eyes. I met someone extraordinary once, they gave me a prescription. It's called the three-flowers and nine-seeds ointment.

MONKEY MAGIC
Could Old Monkey try some?

OLD MAN
Certainly.

The Old Man hands Monkey his cane, and digs around in a box for the ointment.

Pigsy stuffs his face full of rice. The farmers look on at him, a curious sight.

MONKEY MAGIC
This is some great walking stick you have.

OLD MAN
Oh, that! I was journeyman once myself. That walking stick saw me through many hard times. It has the protection of dragons.

MONKEY MAGIC
Dragons? I see!

The Old Man puts ointment on Monkey's face.

OLD MAN
That should do it. See how you fare in the morning.

MONKEY MAGIC
Thank you old man! Thank you!

EXT. GRASS BESIDE THE ROAD WEST - DAY

Monkey wakes up. Pigsy is still asleep next to their luggage. Their horse is tied to a tree.

The cottage is nowhere to be seen. Monkey looks around.

MONKEY MAGIC
They must have been magical!

Pigsy wakes up.

PIGSY
What's happening! Where is the cottage?

MONKEY MAGIC
It appears that they were not farmers but rather, divine guardians, sent to help us.

Pigsy picks up the old man's walking stick.

PIGSY
He left his prized walking stick! Look at your eyes! You can see now!

MONKEY MAGIC
I wonder if this humble walking stick indeed has some magical powers?

PIGSY
Let's go and rescue master!

EXT. CAVE OF THE YELLOW WIND KING - DAY

Monkey and Pigsy crouch behind a rock near the entrance to the cave.

MONKEY MAGIC
You wait here. Time for a little Monkey Magic.

Monkey makes the magic sign and transforms into a Mosquito!

Mosquito Monkey flies to the entrance of the cave, past the guards. He flies inside.

INT. CAVE OF THE YELLOW WIND KING - DAY

Mosquito Monkey flies past a horde of little demons.

KING YELLOW WIND
That lawless ape! This time, when I face him again, I'll use my divine wind to blow him to death! Then we shall feast on his Holy Master.

Monkey flies through to;

INT. CAVE OF YELLOW WIND - DEN - DAY

Tripitaka is tied up and crying. Mosquito monkey lands on his head.

MONKEY MAGIC
Psst! Master! It's me! I've come to rescue you!

TRIPITAKA
Monkey! Where are you!

MONKEY MAGIC
I'm on your head!

TRIPITAKA
That monster is planning to kill you and eat me!

Monkey Magic transforms back to his regular shape.

MONKEY MAGIC
Don't worry master. I have a special magic walking stick!

INT. CAVE OF THE YELLOW WIND KING - DAY

The little demons flee as Monkey enters the King's lair.

MONKEY MAGIC
King Yellow Wind! Let's see how well you can fight!

KING YELLOW WIND
Come for another round? Did you learn nothing the first time!

King Yellow Wind lunges at him. Monkey parries the trident.

Yellow Wind takes a deep breath in, and blows wind! Monkey transforms back into a mosquito and flies out the cave.

EXT. CAVE OF THE YELLOW WIND KING - DAY

King Yellow Wind chases the monkey mosquito outside.

KING YELLOW WIND
Come have another taste of my wind!

Monkey Magic transforms back to his regular shape.

Yellow Wind takes another deep breath in,

MONKEY MAGIC
The stick! Quickly throw it to me!

Pigsy throws Monkey the walking stick. Yellow wind blows!

The walking stick magically sucks up all the wind.

KING YELLOW WIND
The staff of the flying dragon!

The walking staff glows...

And breaks into a thousand pieces as a GOLDEN DRAGON magically emerges, grabs King Yellow Wind in its jaws and bashes him against the mountain.

King Yellow Wind transforms into a YELLOW MINK (a small, cute rodent).

Pigsy returns from the cave mouth with Tripitaka.

PIGSY
Look, he's just a little rodent.

The very cute mink is not sure what to do with itself.

Monkey runs up to him with his rod, is about to strike!

TRIPITAKA
Monkey! Do not hurt him! He is on his own journey, even monsters can become good.

MONKEY MAGIC
You're really no fun sometimes, master.

They depart.

EXT. THE ROAD WEST - DAY

Monkey leads Tripitaka on horse, Pigsy carries the luggage.

WU (V.O.)
Time went by swiftly now, and summer yielded to the arrival of autumn. As they proceeded, they came upon a mighty river...

EXT. FLOWING SAND RIVER - DAY

They arrive at the banks of the mighty sand river.

TRIPITAKA
Disciples, look at that vast expanse of water. Why are there no boats in sight? How are we to get across?

PIGSY
It's very turbulent, too rough for any boat.

MONKEY MAGIC
Master, it's truly hard! I can easily cloud fly across, but you wouldn't be able to cross it in ten thousand years!

TRIPITAKA
I can't even see the other shore from here. How wide is it?

MONKEY MAGIC
It's about eight hundred miles.

Suddenly, waves rise up from the waters -- the fish monster!

The fish monster lunges at Tripitaka. Pigsy intervenes with his muckrake. Monkey carries Tripitaka to higher ground.

MONKEY MAGIC
Master, sit here and don't be afraid. Old Monkey is going to have a bit of fun.

Pigsy and the fish monster battle. 

Magically, they run along the surface of the water. Muckrake meets the monster's staff. They are well matched.

Monkey Magic sprints along the surface of the water, jumps -- slams his rod down on the fish monster's head. 

The fish monster dives into the river, in defeat.

PIGSY
What are you doing? I was just about to capture him, and then you rush in and scare him away!

MONKEY MAGIC
Why do you always try to keep the fun to yourself!

EXT. FLOWING SAND RIVER - BANKS - DAY

Pigsy and Monkey return to Tripitaka who is waiting with horse and luggage.

TRIPITAKA
Did you catch the monster?

MONKEY MAGIC
He didn't last our fight and fled back into the water.

TRIPITAKA
This monster has probably lived here a long time and ought to know the deep and shallow parts of the river. We need someone who is familiar with this region to lead us across.

MONKEY MAGIC
Exactly! When I catch him, I won't kill him -- I'll just make him take Master across the river! Except, I'm not really fond of water.

PIGSY
When I was Marshal of the Heavenly River, I commanded a naval force of some eighty thousand men. I am good with water. Let me go capture the monster.

MONKEY MAGIC
If he has any other monster friends down there, lead them up to the surface and Old Monkey will take care of them...

Pigsy jumps into the water,

INT. FLOWING SAND RIVER - DAY

Pigsy swims towards an underwater cave.

INT. FISH MONSTER'S DEN - DAY

Pigsy emerges into the fish monster's den. It is scattered with bones.

FISH MONSTER
Monk, watch where you are going or you'll receive a blow from this!

The fish monster strikes down on Pigsy with his staff. Pigsy blocks the blow with his muckrake.

PIGSY
What sort of monster are you that you dare bar our way!

FISH MONSTER
I'm not a monster!

PIGSY
Then what are you! And whose skulls  do you wear around your neck? Tell me you name and I'll spare your life.

FISH MONSTER
I am the Curtain-Raising Captain of Heaven.

They continue to exchange blows, with less and less intensity as they converse.

 PIGSY
Really? I thought you looked familiar. Don't you recognise me?

FISH MONSTER
No. Who are you?

PIGSY
I was the Marshal of the Heavenly Reeds. What did you do to get banished?

FISH MONSTER
I broke the Jade Emperor's cup.

PIGSY
The green one?

FISH MONSTER
I'm ashamed to say, yes.

PIGSY
How terrible!

FISH MONSTER
Why were you cast down to Earth?

PIGSY
I got drunk and dallied with the Goddess of the Moon.

FISH MONSTER
Lady Vega?

PIGSY
Love of my life. Now, I'm stuck on this scripture pilgrimage. And we're not even half way there!

The fish monster lights up.

FISH MONSTER
You're travelling with a scripture pilgrim?

EXT. FLOWING SAND RIVER - BANKS - DAY

The fish monster runs up towards Tripitaka and prostrates himself.

FISH MONSTER
Forgive me! Master, please forgive me! I've been waiting such a long time for your arrival that I didn't recognise you. Guanyin told me to become your disciple.

MONKEY MAGIC
You bum! Why didn't you submit in the first place?

TRIPITAKA
Monkey, do not berate him. What are those skulls around your neck?

FISH MONSTER
These? I'm not even sure to tell you the truth?

Tripitaka looks through him.

FISH MONSTER (CONT'D)
Ok! I can't lie! They are the skulls of scripture pilgrims. I ate them in my hunger! Guanyin told me there would be a use for them when the time came.

TRIPITAKA
If you are to become my disciple, will you follow the path of all that is right and good?

FISH MONSTER
I will! I promise I will!

TRIPITAKA
Monster, what is your name?

FISH MONSTER
Sandy, who awakes to purity.

TRIPITAKA
Come Sandy, help us cross this river.

EXT. FLOWING SAND RIVER - BANKS - DAY

The four of them stand at the banks of the mighty river.

TRIPITAKA
How shall we cross?

SANDY
Guanyin gave me this gourd. We can sail across on it.

Sandy shows them the red gourd in his hand.

PIGSY
How are we to fit on that?

MONKEY
And I thought he was the idiot?

SANDY
Watch!

Sandy lays his necklace of skulls on the grass, and puts the red gourd in the middle of it. 

Whispering some magic, Sandy transforms the red gourd to thirty times its size -- into a vessel. He smiles.

EXT. FLOWING SAND RIVER  - DAY

The pilgrims ride their magic vessel over mighty waves. They travel swiftly.

WU (V.O.)
And so the pilgrims crossed the flowing river, and were delivered from its mighty waves.

EXT. THE ROAD WEST -- MONTAGE

Tripitaka on horse is led by Monkey, as Sandy and Pigsy closely follow. They pass through green hills, wild grasses, and lakes.

WU (V.O.)
The way to acquire scriptures is no different from the way of attending to the fundamentals in one's life. Master and disciples, the four of them, who, having awakened to the suchness of all things, broke free from the fetters of dust. They passed through countless green hills and blue waters. Wild grass and untended flowers in endless array. Time was swift indeed and soon it was autumn again. As it was getting late one evening, they came across a wealthy estate...

EXT. ESTATE OF THE JIA FAMILY - NIGHT

A princely estate.

Tripitaka brings the disciples to a halt.

PIGSY
Master, my feet are sore and my belly is empty.

MONKEY MAGIC
Quit complaining you idiot! No one ever said it would be easy!

TRIPITAKA
Disciples, we shall go and beg for lodging at this house.

Pigsy knocks on the gate.

WU (V.O.)
They waited for a long time, but no one came out. Impatient by nature, Monkey leapt the gate to take a look...

INT. ESTATE OF THE JIA FAMILY - HALL - NIGHT

Monkey tours the large halls of the impressive house.

WIDOW (O.S.)
Who are you that you dare enter a widow's home without permission?

Monkey turns around to see a beautiful woman, A WIDOW.

MONKEY MAGIC
We are scripture pilgrims. There are four of us altogether. As we reached your noble region, we approached your house to seek shelter for the night.

WIDOW
Elder, where are your companions? Please invite them to come in.

MONKEY MAGIC (shouting)
Master! You are invited to come in!

Pigsy, Sandy and Tripitaka enter the house.

Pigsy falls in love at the sight of the widow.

WIDOW
Come, let me make you some tea.

INT. ESTATE OF THE JIA FAMILY - DINING ROOM - NIGHT

Tripitaka and her disciples sit around the dining table, drinking tea.

WIDOW
My maiden surname is Jia, and the surname of my husband's family is Mo. Unfortunately, my in-laws died prematurely, and my husband and I inherited our considerable fortune. It was fated, however, that we should have no sons, having given birth to three daughters. The year before last, it was my great misfortune to lose my husband also, and I was left a widow. We have no other relatives beside mother and daughters to inherit our vast property and land. We are delighted therefore, that the four of you have arrived, for we four, mother and daughters, would like very much to ask you to become our husbands. I do not know what you will think of this proposal. Our vast riches would make for a very comfortable life, if you would be willing to change your minds and enter the family of your wives. Will that not be better than the toil of the journey to the West?

Pigsy eagerly looks at Tripitaka -- well? Tripitaka shuts his eyes to quiet his mind of the temptation.

WIDOW (CONT'D)
We have over three hundred acres of paddies, four hundred and sixty acres of dried fields, and over four hundred and sixty acres of orchards and forests. We have countless livestock, over seventy barns and haystacks. In this house there is enough grain to feed you for more than eight or nine years, silk that you could not wear out in a decade, gold and silver that you might spend for a lifetime. You will be most comfortable having all these riches to enjoy.

PIGSY (whispering)
Master! Listen!

WIDOW
Though I am rather homely, my daughters fortunately, are rather good-looking. Moreover, each of them is well trained in the arts. And because we had no son, my late husband brought them up as if they were boys, teaching them some of the Confucian classics as well as the art of writing verse and couplets. If you elders can put away your inhibitions and let your hair grow again, you can at once become masters of this house-hold.

PIGSY (whispering)
Master! How can you ignore what the  lady has been saying to you? Try to pay some attention.

TRIPITAKA
You cursed beast! We are scripture pilgrims. How can we possibly allow ourselves to be moved by riches and tempted by beauty?

WIDOW
I was asking you, with all sincerity, to enter our family and share our wealth, and you insult me instead.

TRIPITAKA
I apologise if I have caused you any offence.

WIDOW
Out! All of you!

EXT. THE ROAD WEST - NIGHT

Tripitaka and his disciples walk along the road.

PIGSY
Master! You really don't know how to handle these maters. The way you spoke! You should have at least given her a vague reply so we could  have enjoyed a pleasant evening.

SANDY (earnest)
Why don't you stay here and become her son-in-law?

MONKEY MAGIC
The idiot is tempted! Look at him!

PIGSY
Which one of us can truly say that he doesn't want this? You're all tempted!

TRIPITAKA
Enough! We shall setup camp for the night.

EXT. ROADSIDE CAMP - NIGHT

Tripitaka is asleep with his disciples, the Jia estate can be seen in the distance.

A shadowy figure weaves towards them through the forest.

It's the widow. She whispers in Pigsy's ear.

WIDOW
Pigsy, follow me.

Pigsy wakes up and nods. He looks around to check the others are still asleep.

She leads him through the forest, to;

EXT. ESTATE OF THE JIA FAMILY - NIGHT

The Widow's three daughters, ZHENZHEN, AIAI and LIANLIAN are waiting on the front porch.

PIGSY
I can't believe it! You're all so gorgeous. Which one of these dear sisters do you plan to give to me?

WIDOW
That's my dilemma. I was going to give you my eldest daughter, but I was afraid of offending my second daughter. I was going to give you my second daughter, but I was afraid then of offending my third daughter. And if I were to give you my third daughter, I fear that my eldest daughter may be offended. That's why I cannot make up my mind.

PIGSY
Mama, if you want to prevent strife, why not give them all to me?

WIDOW
Nonsense! You alone want to take all three of my daughters?

PIGSY
Who doesn't have three or four concubines nowadays? I could also take you as my wife too, if you wanted.

WIDOW
I have a large handkerchief here, with which you can blindfold yourself. I'll ask my daughters to dance around you, and the one you catch will become your betrothed.

The widow puts the blindfold on Pigsy. He giggles.

PIGSY
Come to Pigsy! You dainty little things!

WIDOW
Zhenzhen, Aiai, Lianlian! Come out and determine your fated marriage!

Pigsy grins.

He chases the girls around, in circles, not able to catch any of them.

EXT. ROADSIDE CAMP - DAY

Monkey Magic opens his eyes. It's morning.

SANDY
We are finished!

MONKEY MAGIC
What are you talking about?

SANDY
That estate has vanished! We must have been talking to ghosts!

MONKEY MAGIC
I wonder how that Idiot is going...

SANDY
Pigsy! They've taken Pigsy.

MONKEY MAGIC
He'll be alright. They were just some Holy Immortals, who had waited for us to teach us a lesson.

PIGSY (O.S.)
Master! Save me, please!

EXT. FOREST - DAY

Pigsy is tied up with rope hanging from a tree.

MONKEY MAGIC
What a dear son-in-law, all bound and beaten. Where's your wife?

PIGSY
Very funny. Can someone please untie me!

Sandy helps to untie him.

WU (V.O.)
One must take care in the pursuit of truth to purge desires. And so Pigsy learnt his lesson about lustful habits.

EXT. THE ROAD WEST - DAY

Tripitaka and the pilgrims journey west.

WU (V.O.)
They journeyed onwards and soon came upon a magnificent mountain.

EXT. TALL MOUNTAIN - DAY

The lofty mountain rises up before them.

TRIPITAKA
Disciples, we best be careful as we travel up this mountain for there may be monsters seeking to harm us.

MONKEY MAGIC
Master! Don't fear monsters. Ahead of your horse you have the three of us.

TRIPITAKA
This is some magnificent mountain, perhaps we are not so far from the Thunderclap, and, if so, we should prepare to meet the World's Honored  One.

MONKEY MAGIC
Ha! We're still one hundred and eight thousand miles from the Thunderclap. We haven't even covered a tenth of the distance.

SANDY
How many years will it take us to reach it?

MONKEY MAGIC
You can walk from the time of your youth till the time you grow old, and after that, till you become youthful again. And even after going through such a cycle a thousand times, you may still find it difficult to reach the place you want to go.

TRIPITAKA
Disciple, go somewhere and beg some vegetarian food for me.

MONKEY MAGIC
Master! We are in the middle of a mountain, no village in sight nor any inn behind us. Even if we had money, there's no place for us to buy anything.

TRIPITAKA
You ape! Don't you remember how I freed you from that mountain, why are you not willing to exert yourself a bit more?

MONKEY MAGIC
Master, please don't get upset. A little offence and you will recite that little something spell! Dismount and rest a while. Let me find out if there's any family to beg some vegetarian food.

Tripitaka dismounts from the horse and sits by the road.

Monkey Magic summons his magic cloud and flies off.

EXT. TALL MOUNTAIN (ABOVE THE CLOUDS) - DAY

Monkey Magic flies above the clouds. Scans the horizon.

In the distance are some tiny specks of red.

EXT. TALL MOUNTAIN (BELOW THE CLOUDS) - DAY

Monkey Magic descends on his cloud to Tripitaka.

MONKEY MAGIC
Master! There's something to eat!

TRIPITAKA
What is it?

MONKEY MAGIC
Mountain peaches!

Tripitaka smiles.

EXT. PEACH ORCHID - DAY

Monkey plucks peaches from the tree, filling his basket

WU (V.O.)
A tall mountain will always have monsters. A rugged peak will always produce fiends.

EXT. TALL MOUNTAIN - DAY

A thick fog has descended on the mountain. Tripitaka sits beside Pigsy and Sandy. 

Pigsy notices something in the fog. He lifts up his muck-rake. 

Something moves.

A YOUNG WOMAN emerges from the fog. She has a moon-like face and red lips. Pigsy grins, lowers his guard.

PIGSY
Hello my pretty thing! Where are you going? What's that you are holding in your hands?

YOUNG WOMAN
Elder, what I have in the blue pot is fragrant rice made from wine cakes. I came here for no other reason than to redeem my vow of feeding monks.

PIGSY
Master! The good man will have Heaven's reward!

Pigsy runs back over to Tripitaka.

PIGSY 
Because you were hungry, you asked Elder Brother to go beg some vegetarian food. But we really don't know what that ape has got up to! Take a look at this beautiful girl, she has brought food for us!

Tripitaka stands up, notices the young woman.

TRIPITAKA
Lady Bodhisattva, where is your home? What kind of vow have you made that you have to come here to feed the monks?

YOUNG WOMAN
Master, this mountain which turns back serpents and frightens wild beasts bears the name of White Tiger. My home is due west of here.

TRIPITAKA
Why do you walk the mountain all by  yourself?

The young woman smiles broadly.

YOUNG WOMAN
Actually, my husband is north of this mountain. This happens to be the lunch I prepared for him to eat. But I would very much like to use this rice as food for monks.

Monkey descends on his cloud. The girl's smile vanishes.

Monkey frowns. He carefully puts down his basket of peaches, and pulls out his magic wishing staff.

TRIPITAKA
Monkey! Who have you come back to hit!

MONKEY MAGIC
Master, this girl is a monster and she has come to deceive you.

TRIPITAKA
This kind girl merely wants to feed me with her rice, why do you say she's a monster?

MONKEY MAGIC
Master, how could you know about this? When I was a monster and I wanted to eat people I would change myself into gold or silver, a lonely building, a harmless drunk or a beautiful woman. Anyone feeble-minded enough to be attracted to me I would lure back to my cave and eat!

TRIPITAKA
She's a good person, just trying to help where she can.

MONKEY MAGIC
I think I know what's happening. Your worldly mind has been aroused by the sight of this woman's beauty. Let me build you a little hut right here and you can consummate the affair!

Tripitaka blushes.

MONKEY MAGIC
Why bother fetch the scriptures!

Monkey marches up to the young woman and strikes her dead.

Her body collapses to the ground. Monkey looks back at the others.

MONKEY MAGIC
Don't worry, it's just a fake body.  Any old monster can make a fake body these days.

SANDY
Monkey, what have you done?

PIGSY
He's killed that poor little girl!

MONKEY MAGIC
Don't be offended, Master. Come see for yourself what kind of things are in the pot.

Monkey cracks open the pot -- frogs and spiders jump out.

PIGSY
Master, how could that poor girl be a monster? He's just trying to befuddle you so you won't recite that spell.

TRIPITAKA
Enough!

Tripitaka recites the spell.

MONKEY MAGIC
Ow! My head! Stop it! Stop reciting!

Tripitaka stops the spell.

TRIPITAKA
You practice violence with every step! Since you have beaten to death this innocent commoner what good would it do even if we were to acquire the scriptures? You might as well go back.

MONKEY MAGIC
Where do you want me to go back to?

TRIPITAKA
I don't want you as my disciple.

MONKEY MAGIC
Good luck without me! Do you realise that monsters are trying to eat you!

TRIPITAKA
My life is in the care of Heaven. If it is ordained that I should be food for some monster, even if I were to be steamed or boiled, it's all right with me.

Monkey tries a different tack.

MONKEY MAGIC
Please Master, forgive me.

Tripitaka considers this.

TRIPITAKA
I'll forgive you this time. But if you work violence again as before, I'll recite this spell over and over twenty times.

MONKEY MAGIC
You may recite it thirty times.

Monkey helps Tripitaka onto his horse and hands him a peach.

EXT. ABOVE THE CLOUDS - DAY

THE CADAVER MONSTER gnashes her teeth.

CADAVER MONSTER
That damn Monkey! The Tang Monk was all mine and he ruined it! Time for some more fun...

The Monster dives down through the clouds,

EXT. THE ROAD WEST - DAY

And magically transforms into AN OLD LADY.

THE OLD LADY grins mischievously.

EXT. WHITE TIGER MOUNTAIN - DAY

Tripitaka and his disciples walk the road west.

PIGSY
Monkey you really don't know how to control yourself, do you?

MONKEY MAGIC
You idiot, can't you tell a monster when you see one?

Ahead of them, the Old Lady is weeping.

OLD LADY
My daughter!

PIGSY
Master, it's terrible! That old Mama is looking for someone.

TRIPITAKA
Looking for whom?

PIGSY
The girl slain by Elder Brother has to be her daughter.

MONKEY MAGIC
Nonsense! She's another fake!

Monkey marches up to the Old Lady.

OLD LADY
My daughter... Have you seen her?

MONKEY MAGIC
*My daughter, my daughter*. Nice try you ugly monster!

TRIPITAKA
Monkey no!

Monkey takes out his rod and whacks the Old Lady.

She collapses dead.

Tripitaka recites the Tight-Fillet Spell. Monkey falls to the ground in pain.

MONKEY MAGIC
Ow-ow-ow-ow! Master! Please! Say what you have to say!

Tripitaka stops the spell.

TRIPITAKA
What's there to say? Why do you persist in doing violence? You have beaten to death one commoner after another. How do you explain this?

MONKEY MAGIC
She was a monster!

PIGSY
That poor old woman.

TRIPITAKA
You tell me that there are many monsters! You are a person lacking any will to do good. You'd better go.

MONKEY MAGIC
Fine I'll go, but there's one thing I find disagreeable.

TRIPITAKA
What's that?

MONKEY MAGIC
Some five hundred years ago I was hero enough to receive the submission of the demons of seventy-two caves and to command forty-seven thousand little fiends. Ever since Nirvana delivered me from my sins, I had this gold fillet clamped on my head. I can't face the folks back home like this. Show some human kindness and recite the Loose-Fillet Spell.

TRIPITAKA
Monkey, I only know the Tight-Fillet Spell. There was no Loose-Fillet Spell.

MONKEY MAGIC
Well, if there is no Loose-Fillet Spell you'd better still take me along.

TRIPITAKA
I'll forgive you one more time, but you must not do violence again.

MONKEY MAGIC
I won't dare do so.

Monkey helps Tripitaka onto his horse. They ride on.

EXT. THE ROAD WEST - DAY

They come to an OLD MAN, with flowing white hair, who is reciting the sutras.

TRIPITAKA
The West is truly blessed! This dear old man can hardly walk, but he still wants to recite the sutras!

PIGSY
Master, stop praising him! He is the root of disaster!

TRIPITAKA
What do you mean?

PIGSY
Monkey killed his daughter, and then his wife. If we run smack into him, you'll pay with your life since you are guilty of death. Old Pigsy will be banished to serve in the army. Sandy carries out your orders, so he'll be sentenced to hard labour. And Monkey, of course, will use some kind of escape magic to get away, leaving us to take the blame.

MONKEY MAGIC
You idiot! He's probably just another monster.

Monkey marches up to him.

MONKEY MAGIC
Aged sir, where are you headed?

OLD MAN
This old man has lived here for generations. My whole life is devoted to doing good and feeding monks, and reading scriptures and chanting sutras. My daughter left this morning to take rice down the fields and we fear she might have become food for the tiger instead.

MONKEY MAGIC
Oh really.

OLD MAN
Yes, and my old wife went searching for her, but she, too, did not return. I have no idea what has happened to them.

MONKEY MAGIC
I'm the master of pulling pranks! You can't fool me. I can see that you are a monster!

Monkey takes out his rod and strikes down on the Old Man.

The Old Man crumples into a pile of white bones.

PIGSY
Monkey is acting up again! Look!

Monkey dashes up to Tripitaka who motions for the spell.

MONKEY MAGIC
Wait! Wait! Don't say it! Master! Just come and take a look at how she looks now.

Tripitaka inspects the pile of white bones.

TRIPITAKA
This person just died, how could he change all at once into a skeleton?

MONKEY MAGIC
She's a demon out to seduce and harm people. When she was killed by me, she revealed her true form. You can see for yourself on her spine, she's called “Lady White Bone".

PIGSY
Master, his hand is heavy and his rod is vicious. He has beaten someone to death, but, fearing your spell, he deliberately changed them into something like this just to befuddle you.

Tripitaka recites the spell.

MONKEY MAGIC
OW! Please not that again! If you have something to say, say it quickly!

Tripitaka stops the spell.

TRIPITAKA
You managed to get away even after beating to death three people only because there's no one here to oppose you. Suppose we get to a crowded city and you suddenly start hitting people with that staff of yours, how would I be able to go free from that great misfortune? You'd better go back.

MONKEY MAGIC
Master, you have really wronged me. This was undeniably a monstrous spirit, bent on hurting you. I killed her and saved your life. Instead you believe this Idiot? Nothing can occur three times! If I don't leave you I'll be a shameless fellow. I'll go! It's not big deal for me. I just worry that you'll have no-one to serve you.

TRIPITAKA
No-one? You think Pigsy and Sandy are no-one?

MONKEY MAGIC
I was the one who captured demons and defeated monsters! Now you banish Wisdom to court Folly. The only thing left to settle is that spell of yours.

TRIPITAKA
I won't recite it again.

MONKEY MAGIC
So when you face those treacherous demons and bitter ordeals and these two idiots can't rescue you, I'll have a headache even if I'm one hundred miles away.

TRIPITAKA
Sandy, fetch me my brush and some ink and parchment.

Sandy takes the brush, ink and parchment from the luggage. Tripitaka writes a note on Sandy's back.

TRIPITAKA (CONT'D)
Here. A letter of banishment.

MONKEY MAGIC
An official banishment!

TRIPITAKA
I'll never want you as a disciple. If I ever consent to see you again, let me fall into Hell!

Monkey takes the letter.

MONKEY MAGIC
Good luck without me!

Monkey summons his magic cloud and flies off.

EXT. THE GREAT EASTERN OCEAN - DAY

Monkey cloud flies along the surface of the water, as giant waves crash down.

WU (V.O.)
We were telling you about the Great Sage, who though he was banished by the Tang Monk, was filled with regret and nostalgia when he saw the Great Eastern Ocean. He had not come this way for some five hundred years. On returning to his Flower-Fruit Mountain, he became more grief-stricken than ever...

Monkey flies to,

EXT. THE FLOWER-FRUIT MOUNTAIN - DAY

The mountain is bare, trees dried and withered.

WU (V.O)
On finding it had been burned to total ruin.

Monkey descends on his cloud. He picks up a handful of the scorched earth, tears in his eyes. 

SEVERAL SMALL MONKEYS scurry out from the bushes.

MONKEY #1
Father Great Sage!

MONKEY #2
You've come home!

MONKEY MAGIC
Why is everyone hiding?

MONKEY #2
Since the Great Sage left and became captive in Heaven, we have suffered at the hands of hunters.

MONKEY #3
We dare not play! How could we withstand those sharp arrows and long bows, those yellow hawks and wicked hounds.

MONKEY #2
We conceal ourselves deep in the cave, only in hunger do we go steal some grass on the meadow.

MONKEY #1
We beg you take care of us!

MONKEY MAGIC
In former times, I had forty-seven thousand little monsters here. Where did they go?

MONKEY #1
When Father left, this mountain was burned by Erlang and more than half of them were killed by the fire.

MONKEY #2
The hunters killed many of those who remained. Serving us as food. Those they let live would be taught tricks to perform for the humans.

MONKEY #1
But father, we heard that you regained your life so that you could protect the Tang Monk on his journey? Why are you not heading towards the West?

MONKEY MAGIC
Little ones, that Tang Monk is a stupid idiot. For his sake I caught fiends and overcame demons, using all my abilities. Several times I slew a monster, but accusing me of doing evil and violence, he disowned me and banished me back here.

MONKEY #2
What do you want to be a monk for anyway? Come home and you can lead us again!

MONKEY MAGIC
Let's not break out the wine just yet, how often do those hunters come to our mountain?

MONKEY #3
Great Sage, they are here everyday to cause trouble.

MONKEY MAGIC
Little ones, go up to the mountain and bring back every little rock you can find. Pile them up here. I have a use for them.

The little monkeys all scatter, following his instructions.

Monkey summons his magic cloud.

EXT. FLOWER-FRUIT MOUNTAIN (ABOVE THE CLOUDS) - DAY

Monkey looks over the peak of the mountain to,

EXT. SOUTH OF THE FLOWER FRUIT MOUNTAIN - DAY

A THOUSAND HUNTERS riding horseback, beating drums and striking gongs, are approaching.

EXT. FLOWER-FRUIT MOUNTAIN - DAY

The monkeys have made piles and piles of rocks. Monkey Magic descends on his cloud.

MONKEY MAGIC
Little ones, go hide in the cave. Time for a little Monkey Magic.

The monkeys run into the cave.

Monkey Magic makes the magic sign, and twirls his rod creating a vicious gust of wind. 

The wind lifts the rocks, catapulting them towards the hunters -- smashing them bloodied. It's a massacre.

Monkey Magic grins.

IMAGE: A BANNER - "THE FLOWER-FRUIT MOUNTAIN REBUILT, THE WATER-CURTAIN CAVE RESTORED - GREAT SAGE, EQUAL TO HEAVEN"

EXT. FLOWER-FRUIT MOUNTAIN - VARIOUS - DAY

MONTAGE as Monkeys rebuild the Water-Curtain Cave.

WU (V.O)
The word “monk" was never mentioned again. 

Monkey Magic is visited by the Dragon Kings, with their divine water.

WU (V.O) (CONT'D)
As he enjoyed wide friendship and great power, he had no trouble borrowing some divine water from the Dragon Kings of the Four Oceans to wash his mountain and make it green again. 

Monkeys plant trees, plough the fields. Industrious.

WU (V.O) (CONT'D)
He planted elms and willows, pines and cedars. Peach, pear, date, and plum - he had them all. Then he settled down to enjoy life without any care. 

The Flower-Fruit Mountain is restored to it's former glory.

EXT. THE ROAD WEST - FORESt - DAY

Pigsy hacks through the thick scrub with his muckrake.

TRIPITAKA
Pigsy, I'm getting very hungry today. Where can you find me some vegetarian food to eat?
